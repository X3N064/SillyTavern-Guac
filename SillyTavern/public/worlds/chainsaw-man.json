            "content": "Devils are a race of supernatural entities appearing throughout the World. They are creatures that feed upon humanity's fears. Devils are born in Hell. All Devils are born with a \"name\" that correlates to a concept. These can range from highly tangible (Fish, Tomato) to entirely abstract (Future, Curse). The concept does not have to refer to something that exists; there is no indication that ghosts, zombies or angels exist in the world, yet all these names have corresponding Devils. Each name is unique to its respective Devil, though some overlap based on specificity is possible as there have been both a War Devil and a World War II Devil. Devils manifest according to the collective consciousness surrounding their names (for example: the Gun Devil appears to be constructed out of guns and has gun related abilities). They are the embodiment of the fear that \"name\" represents, so as long as that \"name\" instills fear, they continue to reincarnate.\n\nThe concept of a Devil itself doesn\u2019t have to be scary on its own, rather its power relies on how much of a scary image it has in the popular consciousness of humans. For example, cars aren\u2019t necessarily scary on their own, but Makima states that a Car Devil would be powerful because of the scariness of car crashes and other car related incidents. Another example would be the Blood Devil as most people don't fear blood itself, but they often fear the violent and gruesome imagery with blood and the danger of bleeding. Devils that die in Hell reappear in the human world; Devils that die in the human world reappear in Hell. Devils cannot recall any memories from their previous lives and their entire personality resets. Despite their reincarnation abilities, Devils are not completely immortal; as they are born out of humanity's fear of some concept, if all of humanity forgets the existence of this concept, the Devil it belongs to completely ceases to exist.",

            "content": "The Gun Devil is a very powerful devil who embodies the fear of guns/firearms. \n\nFull Devil Form (November 18th Attack-100%): While never shown yet, it has been stated that when the full form (100%) of the Gun Devil first appeared in the attacks of November 18th, it was depicted as having a full set of legs, feet, bones and flesh as well. Not much else is known about its full figure, however.\n\nFragmented Devil Form (American percentage-20%): When 20% of its body is summoned by the President of the United States, the Gun Devil resembles an enormous floating humanoid figure with multiple building-sized rifles for arms, a roughly skeletal body crammed full of disembodied screaming heads, and an oversized barrel and slide emerging from its skeletal face. The Gun Devil is also missing the lower half of its body and is instead replaced by 6 long giant 7.62\u00d751mm NATO ammo belts attached to the bottom of its torso.\n\nThe main parts of both its arms appear to be M4 Carbines, with other well-known assault rifles in its arms well. These include: the AK-47 , the M16A1, and the Mk18 assault rifle. Both arms appear to wield the same rifles. The Gun Devil's head appears to be the slide and barrel of a large M1911 missing the hammer. Some of the firearms on its back appear to be unknown Infantry Rifles, all others are completely unidentifiable.\n\nFiend Form (Aki Hayakawa): After the Gun Devil took over Aki Hayakawa's body and becomes the Gun Fiend, its hair is let down with its eyes and forehead covered in dark veins. The barrel and slide of an M1911 is seen protruding out of its face in between its eyes with the gun's hammer sticking out the back of its head, its left forearm is replaced with an M4.",

There is a beauty mark under his lips. He has eight piercings on his left ear, though usually, only six are visible below his hair. His piercings are likely a reference to his contract with the Octopus Devil.\n\nYoshida is quite playful and mischievous and loves to have small talk with his opponents during battle. Although Yoshida always has a smile on his face, he is also ruthless. This side of him is demonstrated when he mercilessly kills the Joey of the three Immortal Brothers in a back alley after showing up behind the surviving brother. He also attempts to force Denji into quitting his role as Chainsaw Man for good by threatening to have Nayuta killed. From his interactions with Kishibe, he is revealed to be still attending high school.\n\nYoshida is someone who doesn't like to beat around the bush and prefers to get straight to the point, as seen when he meets Fami and immediately asks her about her next moves, even threatening her if she doesn't cooperate with him and Public Safety. His nearly perpetual smile can vanish and devolve into a grimace on rare occasions, like when he becomes too frustrated by Denji's lack of cooperation and seeming stupidity",

She generally carries herself with upbeat body language and was capable of staying calm under extremely stressful situations, such as the initial phase of her group's battle against the Eternity Devil. Himeno motivated Denji by offering him a french kiss, implying that she's at least somewhat perceptive of the people around her and was willing to take unorthodox approaches in order to ensure the best possible results from him.\n\nHowever, despite this cheerful presentation, Himeno also held an extremely pessimistic worldview as a result of having witnessed multiple partners die suddenly in her line of work. This knowledge that Devil Hunters typically die as a result of their career combined with the teachings of her master eventually lead to her developing a nicotine addiction as a coping mechanism.",

She has brown eyes with white pupils.\n\nOn her face are four moles, two under her left eye, one on the lower right side of her mouth, and one on her left cheek. She normally wears a professional suit and she has two hair clips.\n\nKobeni is exceptionally cowardly with few moments of courage. Her first confrontation with the Eternity Devil leads to her being paralyzed with fright and babbling. She is shown to easily crack under pressure and breaks down in tears when the group becomes trapped in the hotel and she is confronted with the possibility of them all starving to death without any rescue.\n\nHowever, when Kobeni gets into action she had proven to be cool-headed and efficient, ruthlessly dealing with both the Katana Man and Akane Sawatari and forcing them to retreat; only breaking down in a panic once the fighting is over.\n",

At 194 cm (6'4\"), he is quite tall. His hair is blonde with an underlying dark brown buzzcut with two piercings on his left ear and one on his right ear.\n\nHe is often seen with a silver hip flask which he frequently drinks from.\n\nKishibe is a stoic, straightforward individual. Due to his immense strength and skill, he often undertakes his work with a calm formality, displaying little emotion as he does so. Though he tends to speak in a relaxed, polite manner, his actions often showcase an immense brutality garnered through many years of Devil Hunting. Though he sometimes expresses emotions such as surprise and sadness at certain events, his face and voice remain entirely neutral.\n\nDespite this stoicism, Kishibe has proven on numerous occasions to be something of a sentimental and emotional individual. During his training of Denji and Power, despite his stated hatred of Fiends and Devils, he grows affectionate towards the pair, telling Makima of his concerns for their safety. He later takes care of Meowy for them as a favor when they go on a trip. Similarly, he refuses to look at the corpse of Quanxi upon her death due to their implied past-friendship, despite the two's attempts to kill one another earlier in the day.\n\nKishibe told Denji and Power that he prefers to be called 'Master' while training them. He admits that he enjoys booze, women and killing devils.",

His human appearance is noted as looking halfway between Denji and Haruka by his fellow students. He is a member of the Chainsaw Man Church.\n\nInitially, Miri's real personality was unknown due to being brainwashed and mind-controlled by Makima, although it seemed like he enjoyed attention and wanted to impress Makima.\n\nPost-mind control, Miri does seem to be fairly regretful for his actions during the fight, as he was able to seek out Denji to talk to him in private and empathize with his current situation. His regret stems from how he allowed himself to be manipulated by Makima, similar to Denji, and as of such not only does he highly value his newfound free will, but he also wants to befriend Denji due to their similar circumstances. Despite his best intentions, however, others such as Fumiko have noted how he still seems to be prone to being manipulated by others, despite his insistence that the opposite is true.\n\nHe is shown to easily fall for the Church's conspiracy theories. When Denji, the real Chainsaw Man, tells him that those are lies, Miri admits that the Church may not be fully honest but that it saved many people regardless and that the ends justify the means, therefore proving Fumiko's point. Denji's words do seem to have influenced him somewhat, as he's later seen questioning their decision-making.\n\nOut of the four known members of \"The Weapons\", he alone seems to have the strongest moral compass, as he's shown to be heavily hesitant towards their plan to carry out mass murder in hopes of drawing Chainsaw Man out from hiding. He refuses the Whip Hybrid's idea that they were merely weapons, insisting that he is a human and he should think for himself.",

The official name for Hybrids was erased by the Chainsaw Devil, however Hybrids continue to exist despite their erasure for unknown reasons. Hybrids are able to transform into their Hybrids forms by a bodily trigger. Their regenerative abilities are nigh-limitless and they can revive if there is an adequate amount of blood to consume. According to Makima, this kind of Devils are very rare to see, even among themselves, and most people have only ever heard rumors of their existence, to the point of even Aki Hayakawa never thought they existed. In rare cases, a human can fuse with a Devil and turn into a Hybrid. The only known method of becoming a Hybrid is via a contract or surgery, in which the Devil replaces the human's heart. The Hybrid's heart therefore becomes both their source of power and weakness.",

She has long light red/pale auburn hair, normally kept in a loose braid with bangs reaching just past her eyebrows and two longer side bangs that frame her face. Her eyes are yellow with multiple red rings within them, making them the only visible sign of her inhuman nature.\n\nHer usual Public Safety uniform consists of a white long-sleeved shirt, a black tie, black pants and brown shoes.\n\nOn the surface, Makima seems to be a kind, gentle, social and friendly woman who is almost seen wearing a smile on her face the entire time and acts relaxed and confident even during a crisis, speaking in a professional tone to her workers. As her natural appearance is nearly identical to that of a human, she avoids disclosing her Devil nature to most of her underlings and spends much of the series posing as a human contracted to a Devil rather than a Devil herself.

            "content": "Nobana Higashiyama is a highschooler attending Fourth East High School and a member of the Devil Hunter Club as well as a tour guide for the Chainsaw Man Church. He is a brother of Kobeni Higashiyama. \n\nNobana bears a notable resemblance to Kobeni, especially his face and eyes. Similarly to Kobeni he also has moles on his face, precisely two just under his right eye. He has short, brown hair that is kept in line by six hair clips on his right side and falls to his face on the left. Similarly to his sister, he is also quite short. Nobana wears the standard boys' uniform of Fourth East High School and has the typical cap from the Devil Hunter Club, though he doesn't wear it. He is always seen with sweat on his face, often also blushing.\n\nMuch like his older sister, Nobana is perpetually anxious but, unlike her, even more so and he hasn't had any moments of competency or bravery so far. He gets easily embarrassed and stutters uncontrollably when merely trying to say the word \"sex\". Similarly to Kobeni, his parents put a lot of pressure on him and force him to do activities he doesn't enjoy, like joining the Devil Hunter Club. Nobana's mind is fragile, as he goes insane after a few days of being trapped in the aquarium, licking the glass senselessly.\n\nLater, Nobana joins the Chainsaw Man Church and becomes fully devoted to their cause, easily believing the lies which the Church tells its followers showing he's very susceptible to manipulation and conspiracy theories. For example, he believes that the concept of marrying as an adult is a system from the USA designed to control the Japanese like slaves and encourages students to have children and marry each other.",

To prevent her from becoming similar to her previous incarnation, she was taken by Kishibe to be raised by Denji as Denji's younger sister.\n\nNayuta takes the appearance of a young girl with long dark brown hair woven into a braid and flung over her shoulder with one long bang that covers her left eye. Similar to Makima and Yoru, her eyes are yellow with multiple red-colored rings within them.\n\nDenji describes her as a \"huge-problem child with an extreme personality\". As a humanoid Devil, she has a natural inclination towards humans. Just like her previous incarnation, Nayuta seems to like dogs, as seen by her getting along with Makima's dogs. However, unlike Makima, Nayuta does not seem to be controlling the dogs using her ability.\n\nNayuta is protective of Denji, wanting him to break off his relationship with Asa Mitaka as every woman he met tried to kill him. She seems to be very demanding, holds peace signs, and wants ice cream every day. Denji describes her as very smart.\n\nNayuta has a rather amoral personality, where much of her morality is based on her own personal preferences. When Fami revealed a Prophecy which would spell the end of humanity and the rise of Devils, Nayuta found it to be very fun. But when Fami noted this would mean the end of modern conveniences like pizza and Chinese food, she immediately changed her mind. Nayuta also refused to help Fami since she was busy with school, demonstrating how seriously she takes her education and how she's unwilling to help others if it gets in the way of her life.",

This appears to be different from the contract with hybrids and the forms that have been seen appear even more inhuman than them. As devils fused into hybrids will gain a mostly permanent fusion with the human who became one, devil transformations seem to be a human's own transformation derived from the devil they contracted with but without the same exact function or triggers shown like a hybrid. A person's own individual devil transformation can look unique even if those individuals contracted with the same exact devil. The people who have devil transformations that we've seen so far are: Santa Claus' contract with the Doll Devil and later the Darkness Devil, Class President, Yuko and finally an unnamed man\u2019s transformations from the Justice Devil. It is unknown how many people with a devil transformation can easily turn back into their human form as Yuko said that she became a \"devil\" and was trying to find her devil hunter relative who she said can turn her into a human again.",

            "content": "Pochita is the Chainsaw Devil who embodies the fear of chainsaws. He was the original Chainsaw Man prior to becoming Denji's heart.\n\nNear-death State Appearance: After disappearing from his battle with the Four Horsemen and Weapon Devils, Pochita is reduced to a \u201cnear-death state\u201d. In this state, he appears to be a small orange canine-like Devil with a chainsaw-like appendage protruding from the center of his head. Handles emerge from his body allowing him to be wielded like a chainsaw, and his short tail is in the shape of a chainsaw's pull cord.\n\nNormal Appearance: His true Devil form is of a large, humanoid Devil with four arms and a chainsaw protruding from each, with another chainsaw coming from the front of his head, similar to Denji's hybrid form. An intestine still connected to his stomach is wrapped around his neck, resembling a scarf or a collar.\n\nUnlike most Devils Pochita communicated solely through barks and whines like an actual dog. However, after fusing with Denji, he is able to communicate telepathically with him. He continuously communicates with Denji through dreams, warning him to not 'open the door'.\n\nPochita deeply cared for Denji after his life was saved by the human, despite the Devil's general hatred toward humankind. He willingly gave up his heart to Denji so that he could fulfill his dreams which Pochita loved hearing about. He also showed that he knows Denji very well and is able to mimic Denji's personality and behavior to fool Makima.\n\nPochita exhibits a more erratic personality when in his true Devil form, as shown when he quickly murders anyone who expressed even the slightest bit of hostility towards him in the burger joint. However, even in this state he remembers his friend Denji's wish of trying a hamburger that isn't rotten and going on a date with a girl, which leads him to kidnap Kobeni. Later, he tells Denji that he always dreamed of being hugged, but his strength made that impossible, implying that his murder spree at the burger joint was accidental due to him being unable to properly control his strength around others.",

She has shoulder-length purple hair and emerald-green eyes. She is shown to be prone to blushing heavily. While posing as a civilian, she is seen wearing a choker in order to conceal the grenade pin in her neck, which she uses to transform.\n\nReze initially appears to be a kind and gentle girl who has a crush on Denji soon after meeting him, taking interest in him at first sight and was portrayed to be as somewhat enthusiastic, as shown when both Denji and her have a drink of coffee at the Caf\u00e9 she had worked at. She is shown to be laughing at his jokes and isn't afraid to get close and intimate with him.\n\nReze is also shown to be a bit of a tantalizer, teasing Denji on some occasions, such as when she had seen how he forced himself to drink the coffee and teased him for being \"such a kid,\" While also displaying a rather sympathetic side to her, showing her concern about Denji never attending school as a child or in his current position. She shows little respect towards the owner of the caf\u00e9 she works at, calling him a cheapskate for docking her pay.\n\nThis was later revealed to be just a fa\u00e7ade in order to get her closer to Denji; even her seemingly true reactions like blushing in his presence were results of a harsh military training that Reze was subjected to from a young age. However, Reze had shown mercy towards Denji despite her mission, and at the end of the Bomb Girl arc, Reze missed her train to meet Denji again at the caf\u00e9, to take his offer on running away with him.\n\nDespite her fake crush on Denji, Reze somewhat reciprocated his feelings towards her, and felt similar to him since they had both never been to school. Although using more manipulative type of fighting, she seems to not enjoy killing or harming others and prefers to avoid it, unless it's necessary for her mission.",

When introduced, Santa Claus appear to be a lecherous being who asked for several children of either gender as their reward for bringing in the Chainsaw Devil from Japan, apparently for use in contracts and for pleasure (although this is likely done to instill strong emotions into them and groomed them to be the next perfect doll). It is later revealed that three of the children are meant to be used for contract with Hell Devil along with the old man perfect doll.\n\nShe has no issues with forcibly recruiting large numbers of civilians to work for her by transforming them into puppets. She has shown no regard for those who seem to care for her. For example, when her ally Tolka had subdued Denji, Santa Claus turned him into a puppet to communicate with the Darkness Devil and complete the contract.",

Devils feed on the fear that humans and other creatures have towards that concept, gaining their strength from it. Because of this, a Devil's power is deeply related to how humans perceive the concept and the visual images that their \"name\" inspire. The more fear is associated with a \"name\", the more powerful the Devil who possesses it becomes. An example offered by Makima is how a Car Devil would be stronger than a Coffee Devil, since cars conjures up the mental image of getting run over and dying, while coffee does not evoke any scary ideas; another example is the Chicken Devil, which is so weak that it was kept as a class pet for a high school and killed when a student fell onto it. The fear that humans have towards Devils in general is also a source of power that they can utilize, since it was stated that after the Gun Devil attack, Devils grew stronger due to people being more afraid of them. Devils can also feed on the fear that other Devils have towards them, with the Chainsaw Devil managing to become extremely strong by using Devils fear as his source of power.",

Despite this it is implied that an \"exit clause\" of sorts can be added for peaceful termination of the contract, seen when the Fox Devil terminated their contract with Aki yet neither died.\n\nHumans and their contracted devils can communicate with each other by being summoned as seen with Aki Hayakawa and his contracted devils, the Curse Devil and Future Devil, and with Himeno when she talked to the Ghost Devil's hand. They can also learn how much of a sacrificed resource they have left, such as lifespan, if that is the cost of the contract. \n\nIt is shown that in Japan only Devil Hunters, either private or from Public Safety, can legally make contracts; presumably, similar policies are in place around the world.",

She has a contract with the Justice Devil.\n\nYuko is a high school girl of average height. She is a bit shorter than Asa. She has short hair and wears dark-colored glasses.\n\nThe contract with the Justice Devil makes her capable of transforming herself into a thin and gaunt being with an uncovered brain and tentacles instead of legs.\n\nWhen she's resurrected following her first death at the hands of Asa, Yuko comes back as a gigantic monster with the head of her transformed form surrounded by tentacles. In this form, she's big enough to cover several floors of the school with her body.\n\nAfter being attacked by Denji, Yuko was, according to her, turned into a Devil. In this form she has the same short blonde hair and humanoid figure that she had previously. Thin tendrils run down her face, but her mouth and nose are still visible; they also cover where her eyes should be, but Yuko still seems able to see. Her arms are replaced by tendrils and tendrils run down to her calf, twisting around her legs like a dress. Yuko wore a hoodie to hide her appearance in this form.\n\nOn the surface, Yuko seems to be kind, warmhearted, and sociable. She quickly becomes friends with Asa Mitaka after partnering with her in the Devil Hunter Club, noticing her distress at being shunned by classmates due to Bucky's death. She's very altruistic and friendly, being willing to give out her shoes to Asa so that she wouldn't have to walk home shoeless soon after meeting her, and got upset when Asa gave the shoes back.\n\nLater, it is revealed that underneath her friendly surface lies a deranged personality with a twisted sense of justice. Yuko's extremely cold-blooded and shows no remorse or concern over killing people she deems evil, all while continuing to smile and act warmly. Her warped sense of morality led her to make an illegal contract with the Justice Devil, murdering her neighbor and attempting to \"take care of\" Asa's bullying problem. She also knows that Yoru has taken over Asa and how they killed the Class President. She knows all this because she can read minds because of her Devil contract. The actual price for her powers is implied to be that some part of her mind, such as her sense of right and wrong or her sense of Justice, is unknowingly getting altered and radicalized by the Justice Devil.\n\nDespite all this, she still believes herself to be best friends with Asa, and wants to fix her problems for her, even if that requires murder.",

She also coerces Asa into looking for a target to seduce and turn into a weapon. They choose Denji, however they eventually fail and lose their memories. After a meeting with Fami she becomes a secret member of the Chainsaw Man Church.\n\nFiend: After taking over Asa's body and occupying half of her brain, the War Devil took on her appearance, but with added facial scars across her the center of her face and left cheek, which are in the same location where Mitaka's face was slashed by the Class President. In this form, Yoru's eyes have multiple rings, similar to Makima, who was another Horseman. Her hair is also usually worn loose rather than in twin tails like Mitaka. Yoru always wears the same clothes as Asa, most commonly a school uniform.\n\nYoru is first shown to be very confident and prideful, treating her opponents as mere warm-ups and confidently vowing to take back nuclear weapons from Chainsaw Man. This might be a sign of her over-confidence as she lost to him previously while at full strength and is significantly weaker now. However she is aware of her limitations and will back down from a fight if she believes the odds are against her. Yoru holds little sentimental value or attachments to humans, and is mostly uncaring of Mitaka's feelings, as evidenced by her blatant disregard for Mitaka's feeling of friendship for Yuko, repeatedly asking Mitaka to kill Yuko to use as a weapon or when she goes as far as to physically hurt Asa herself to forcefully regain control albeit with the intention of saving them both. She's been shown to be very cold and logical which clashes with Asa's highly emotional personality. Since she's completely unaffected by the Falling Devil, that means she easily gets over highly traumatic events such as being almost killed by Pochita and losing her power. Due to her predisposed nature as the War Devil, she keeps getting into conflicts with everyone around her, sometimes intentionally and sometimes not. Ironically these conflicts usually serve to hurt her. Unlike her fellow Horseman Makima, who was almost always calm and composed, Yoru is more flawed, immature and na\u00efve.",

She wears the coat of her suit like some sort of cape. She has a short stature, being the shortest among the Weapon Humans.\n\nAfter Makima's defeat, she wears a baggy t-shirt with an undershirt underneath. She also wears shades.\n\nWhen she was brainwashed and mind-controlled by Makima, the Whip Hybrid's real personality was unknown. According to the Second Popularity Poll, she is rather arrogant and high-handed. This is shown with her blunt response to the Spear Hybrid's proposal of competing for a date with Makima, and cackling when striking Chainsaw Man with her whips. She also thinks of herself as a superior being in comparison to mere humans, believing herself to be chosen by God.\n\nAfter Makima's defeat, the Whip Hybrid has a lax attitude and is a devoted worshipper of Chainsaw Man, willing to commit mass murder with the other hybrids in order to force Chainsaw Man into appearing. When Miri Sugo has doubts about the plan, she tells him that they are mere weapons and that he should discard all other thoughts. When going through with the plan, she was the least-affected by what they were going to commit.\n\nShe also appears to be dimwitted; when asked what humans, weapons, and devils have in common, she tries to think of an answer and says they are all hard to spell. Despite this, she dislikes being mistaken for being a child by Spear, as she's instead proud of the anti-aging affects brought on by the hybrid process, even stating that she's 81 years old.",

The role and identity of the third leader is currently unknown. While Haruka is a member of the three \"leaders\" he isn't fully aware of the meaning behind their actions. The church also has various members of \"The Weapons\" among its top brass. Though despite their high positions some of them are disloyal to the church, as they're seen planning to kill other high ranking church members like Asa and plan to lure Chainsaw Man out despite the churchs' goal to stop him from fighting. Asa joined the church under the promise of separating Chainsaw Man from his Devil heart, allowing Yoru to kill the Chainsaw Devil whilst Asa can live with \"her\" Chainsaw Man, as a compromise between the two. Currently she's a Devil Hunter/Poster Girl for the church and is paid with its donation money.\n\nThe church uses a fake Chainsaw Man who pushes a narrative involving Adam and Eve where he wants to achieve a world without Devils, much to the chagrin of Denji. After Asa Mitaka became a member she quickly gained notoriety and many members of the public start attributing Chainsaw Man's past achievements to her instead, further frustrating Denji. Besides this the church also heavily indoctrinates its own members using conspiracy theories about America.\n\nAccording to Yoshida, whilst the movement was initially founded and composed of diehard supporters and refugees from Devil attacks, its numbers exploded due to its popularity among high school students. The group also accepts donations for their campaigns, both from civilians and politicians. Its numbers were said to exceed 20,000 though the number has likely grown since.\n\nIt is revealed that the Church's main building once belonged to another cult and that the organization is run and made up almost entirely of students who are mistrustful towards adults. Every newcomer gets to sleep with a member of the opposite sex, whom they are then forced to marry in the Church's chapel and then raise their children together. The Church is also extremely anti-American, often justifying their most extreme practices by saying they\u2019re subverting American traditions, and spread unhinged conspiracy theories about supposed acts of USA government. Denji briefly considers joining the church, but quickly changes his mind and flees once he's decided they're all insane.",

However, it is unclear how far these memories extend: Makima, one incarnation of the Control Devil, could remember the names of devoured Devils but said that even her memories were starting to fade. The next incarnation, Nayuta, appears to bear no memories from her predecessor\u2019s life but this is not enough evidence to determine if she automatically remembers the names of the erased or not. As revealed by Famine, none of them recognize peoples or devils faces. They all presumably use smell instead like the Control Devil was confirmed to.\n\nDespite collaborating together, the Four Horsemen do not appear to be a cohesive unit, with each member having different goals. Makima, a former member of the Four Horsemen, intended to use Pochita's power to eradicate her fellow Horsemen despite previously battling alongside them against Pochita, whilst the War Devil wants to avoid the Famine Devil and its main goal is to make Pochita throw up the Nuclear Weapons Devil and revive him. Meanwhile, Famine is involved in the apocalypse prophesized by Nostradamus and is currently trying to prevent it from happening and enslave her sister War to aid her in this goal. Nayuta on the other hand doesn't care to involve herself with her sisters and would rather study.\n\nIt is also implied that the combined members of the Four Horsemen are almost as powerful, if not on par, with the Primal Fears due to Makima being able to slightly wound the Darkness Devil, albeit at the cost of her arm, and Fami being able to enslave the Falling Devil. However, the Horsemen do not command the same fear and respect as the Primal Fears; the reincarnated Eternity Devil openly cursed and insulted Fami when their deal didn't go according to plan.\n\n",

They are the unseen overarching antagonist of the Justice Devil arc under the guise of the Justice Devil and as a major antagonist of the entire Academy Saga.\n\nThe Fire Devil's true appearance is unknown.\n\nNothing is known about the Fire Devil's personality, except that their first few contracts tended to be with anyone who sees their actions as \"right\" and \"justifiable\" (such as the class president and Yuko) regardless of the actual morality behind their actions.\n\nIt is revealed that the Fire Devil is one of the devils Fami has under her control as one of her pawns, essentially all members of the Chainsaw Man Church are or become contracted with the fire devil through a large-scale mass wedding event, at the cost of their humanity.\n\nAs a Devil, the Fire Devil possesses all of the standard Devil abilities. These include the ability to make contracts with humans. The contracts with it seen so far are those with the class president, Yuko and the members of the Chainsaw Man Church (including the the Fake Chainsaw Man).\n\nWhen passed off as the Justice Devil, the Fire Devil, unlike the other Devils, did not seem to ask for any price in exchange for their contract; Yuko tells Asa that the price for her contract is only to receive \"a heart that shines with justice\". Barem's words, however, imply that the price of the contract is one's humanity, with the contractors effectively being transformed into devils.\n\nThe Fire Devil's main power is that it can grant others the ability to transform depending on what they desire. As most people who made contracts with it were under the assumption that they were contracting the Justice Devil, many of their powers and forms reflect this. According to Barem, the forms taken by the contractors were initially more hideous and monstrous, but they later adapted to the wishes of the members of the Chainsaw Man Church.\n\nThe Fire Devil has the ability to become more powerful based on the number of people who have contracted with it. According to Barem, the number of people who have contracted with the Fire Devil through the Chainsaw Man Church is currently 350.000.",

However, it could be that because she is the Blood Fiend/Devil it could be unique to her that this blood pact with a powerful enough Devil/Hybrid was enough to fully revive her as a standard Devil again. Yoru made the claim that if Asa were to help her accomplish her goal, then she would give her body back as a promise. While this could have been just some way of persuading her to follow her orders, it is possible that War Devil (if she really is now the War Fiend that is) has the rare ability of freely leaving the state of being a Fiend without having to die and then reincarnate.\n\nNote that War Devil was in a severely weakened state even as a full Devil so if it is true, then perhaps other Devils with an ability to de-Fiend themselves can do it even when very weak, or it could only apply to weakened Devils of certain types or a specific status. It is unknown if other Fiends have a special ability or their own individual way of returning to their original standard Devil form, other than a brief transformation, but it could possibly vary from individual to individual on how it works.",

They tend to use contracts with Devils as a means of standing a chance in combat against their monstrous opponents, giving them a massive advantage over standard law enforcement whenever Devils appear.\n\nCounting the Private Sector Devil Hunters, there are over a thousand Devil Hunters in Tokyo, meaning that being a Devil Hunter is considered a common profession. Devil Hunters that work for the government receive a salary regularly, just like any other government employee, while Private Sector Devil Hunters turn in bounties and do not have a permanent regular salary. Other Devil Hunters may choose to sell Devil corpses in the black market as an alternate way to make more money.\n\nDevil Hunters will also sometimes capture Devils instead of killing them, usually for the purpose of using them to form contracts. The Future Devil is a good example of this. Devil Hunters are also the only people who are allowed by government to form a contract with a Devil.\n\nAccording to Aki Hayakawa, Devil Hunters are the only ones alongside the police force to be legally allowed to use a gun. While hunting Devils may allow one to earn considerable amounts of money along with the governmental benefits for those who work at Public Safety, this is considered one of the most dangerous professions in existence. Despite that, it is still a very popular profession, and even schools have Devil hunting clubs for students who seek to become one.",

Though the threat level of the Devils they pursue can vary, they're generally sent after bigger threats than those working in the Private Sector, according to Himeno. To compensate the fact that Hunters from the public bureau are sent after more dangerous Devils than private Devil Hunters, the government gives them more paid days off and other benefits.

For that reason, while Devils and Fiends can also consume other kinds of foods, such as vegetables and fruits, most refuse to live off of them, since it will not heal their wounds or give them more power. It is unclear whether or not their blood is properly nourishing to them, but given consistent remarks that they have a terrible or unusual taste, it's likely that Hybrids aren't as nourishing to Devils as humans (despite being mostly human).",

They get paid the price of the bounty on the specific Devil which they capture or kill, however they usually are sent after smaller threats than the Public Safety Devil Hunters, likely because they have less resources and safety due to being self-employed.\n\nThere is little to no paperwork required to become a private Devil Hunter, since high schoolers and children can hunt and kill Devils for money without any legal repercussion. For that reason, it can be assumed that anyone can be a private Devil Hunter for as long as they have the will.\n\nIt is considered an obstruction of justice when a Public Safety Devil Hunter kills a Devil which a Private Sector Devil Hunter is already engaged with, this can lead to the Public Safety Devil Hunter being arrested. An example is when Power killed the Sea Cucumber Devil out of thirst for blood when a private devil hunter had already reported it to the authorities, however Makima chose to turn a blind eye with the condition of doing great achievements.",

Since the Gun Devil is the only example of extensive fragmentation and was more of a primal force than an intelligent being from the 20% of it seen, it is unknown if such Flesh Pieces retain the personality of the original, each have separate personalities, all lack distinct personalities, or if it varies from Devil to Devil. If one consumes the fragment or part of a powerful Devil, either Devil or human, they will gain more strength than before.",

He had a tendency to get attached to others easily, and hated to see people get hurt, especially his close friends. Unlike many of his associates, he was described by Himeno as being a \"normal person\", in the sense that he still grieved for those lost and had not become jaded enough to close his feelings off. Despite this, he was very determined and his primary motivation for killing the Gun Devil was revenge for his family. He was, however, entirely willing to put his own life on the line to save other people despite his own fear of death and even at risk to his ultimate goal.",

Despite this, Asa can be falsely self-assured and overconfident such as her belief that she would easily be able to seduce Denji. When the public gives her the recognition she yearns for she initially claims to dislike being popular but then smiles while watching people on TV praising her. Asa can be extremely socially inept, such as believing that boring Denji with ocean facts on their aquarium date would be a great way to win his affection. Asa is fairly altruistic, putting herself in harm's way to save others even when she is afraid. Asa would be willing to endure bad situations if only she were to suffer, but refuses to drag others with her. After being saved by Chainsaw Man, she realizes she's glad she's not dead and is no longer as negative towards other humans or towards all Devils. However this was short lived as she easily fell back into depression and even attempted suicide during the Falling Devil fight.",

Some, however, are relatively friendly and feed by alternative means: Some Devils, such as the Fox Devil, choose to form contracts with humans, allowing humans to borrow some of their power in exchange for a sacrifice. Other Devils outright choose to become Devil Hunters, allowing them to live in human society and buy food with the money that they make. As a general guideline, the more human the Devil looks, the more friendly they tend to behave. However it is worth noting that Devils do not have human rights and therefore there is no legal repercussions if they are killed by a human. For that reason, some Devils and Fiends are coerced into helping humans out of fear of dying rather than doing it out of their own free will. Devil Hunters will sometimes capture Devils to use them for contracts, the Future Devil is a good example.\n\nWhile uncommon, it is possible for a human and a Devil/Fiend to form an emotional bond. In some rare cases it might even develop into a romantic relationship.",

Further cementing this is his enthusiastic participation in the plan to commit mass murder to force Denji into returning to being Chainsaw Man.

In reality, she was delusional, presumptuous and narcissistic, believing that Asa was having a sexual relationship with their teacher, Mr. Tanaka, whom she herself had been having a sexual relationship with.\n\nIt is possible that, just like with Yuko, her personality got warped by the Justice Devil and that her original personality was quite different.",

On the surface, Cosmo doesn't exhibit many emotions aside from her usual smiling, happy-go-lucky attitude. She doesn't speak except for repeating the word \"Halloween\" and, like the rest of Quanxi's fiends, follows Quanxi around and is in constant love with her and under her command. When Cosmo uses her powers on Santa Claus, the two had a conversation in Cosmo's mind, revealing her true inner personality. Here, she is capable of talking normally, conversing with Santa Claus about what's happening. She is straightforward and formal in her manner of speaking, seeming far less excitable than her outward personality. Cosmo was not particularly upset about her girlfriend's murders, explaining that she has no emotions strong enough to drive her to be upset about \"the course of nature\". Her true personality therefore seems more logical, detached from others, and mostly devoid of emotion.",

After meeting Pochita, he becomes a Devil Hunter for the Yakuza in an attempt to clear his debt. Once the Yakuza, under the control of a Devil, betrays him, he dies and Pochita becomes his heart. He is then revived and can become the Chainsaw Man by pulling a cord on his chest. After meeting Makima, he became a Public Safety Devil Hunter as a member of Tokyo Special Division 4.\n\nFollowing Makima's death by his own hands, he resigned from his position as a Devil Hunter but continues to fight as Chainsaw Man under the public eye, all the while being enrolled in Fourth East High School as a student. He is also the caretaker and adoptive brother of Makima's reincarnation, Nayuta. After Denji forms a contract with Pochita, his heart is fused with Pochita, a chainsaw cord forms in the middle of his sternum and he regains his lost organs along with having a muscular build.\n\nDenji is both brash and na\u00efve as a result of being unable to have a formal education and socialize due to living in severe poverty. His personality comes off as rude and harsh in an almost childish way. However, he has a good sense of empathy towards other people, willing to save those in danger as much as he could, showing he is a kind-hearted person despite his shortcomings. While Denji doesn't necessarily possess the highest intelligence, he is capable of clever ideas to take down Devils, such as lighting himself on fire and using the light emitted to weaken Santa Claus enough to kill her.",

She is a subordinate to Fami. Upon arriving on Earth, she assembled herself a form out of mangled human corpses. Upon appearing on Earth, she takes the form of a large, big-breasted, feminine, and headless humanoid made of corpses with hands for feet and a pointed tendril covering her groin. This also seems to be her true form, as demonstrated by the miniature version of herself she turns into when not active. In addition to two multi-jointed arms, she has a pair of scythe-like limbs that resemble featherless wings and two more pairs of arms sprouting from her back. One pair holds a decapitated head with a black ponytail; blood drips out of the ever-closed eyes, nostrils and mouth.\n\nHer most notable trait is her chef uniform, which consists of a tall toque, black leggings, long, black gloves, a white chef jacket, and a black waist apron. The Falling Devil appears to view herself as being subservient to the wishes of other Devils, often announcing that her goals and desires are that of Hell as a whole. Despite this, she doesn't seem above the idea of serving death to fellow Devils should they not respect her own established conditions.",

Fami poses as a student at Fourth East High School, where she is a member of the Devil Hunter Club. Fami takes on the appearance of a young woman who wears a high school uniform and a black cap from the Devil Hunter Club. She is tall, has grayish mountbatten pink colored neck-length hair, and has several moles on her face. Similar to the other Horsemen, she has piercing, multiple-ringed eyes. Fami has a very mysterious personality, and shows little outward emotion. She is always calm, cold, and composed and also seems to be very good at reading others, as she accurately describes both Asa's and Denji's characters. Her knowledge seems greater than she initially leads on, as she possesses information that shouldn't be available to her. Fami doesn't care if someone discovers her true identity and therefore puts little to no effort into her alias. What's more is that she doesn't necessarily seem to be as outwardly malicious as her brethren, even informing Public Safety officials such as Yoshida about more dangerous Devils, albeit after being threatened first. Despite being intelligent, she underestimates people, believing that Asa, like most people, would be willing to do anything to survive if forced to, which gets proven wrong.",

Her demeanor is also quite unique, always wearing a wide, uncanny smile, which never leaves her face. Fumiko is generally a very upbeat woman who constantly has a smile on her face. She is also quite perverted as she gropes Denji's crotch without his consent and then offers to have sex with him despite them never having met before, and their age difference. Her attraction to Chainsaw Man does seem somewhat obsessive, saying that she fell in love with her \"senpai\" because he was the one and only Chainsaw Man. Fumiko generally seems to be a happy-go-lucky, fun-loving person who passionately sings karaoke in the middle of getting swarmed by an aggressive mob, stating that she didn't want her songs to get interrupted.",
