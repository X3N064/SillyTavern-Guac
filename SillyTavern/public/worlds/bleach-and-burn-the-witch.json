They fight using a power from outside. They have an easier time collecting this energy in environments with higher concentrations of Reishi such as in Soul Society or Hueco Mundo. To a sufficiently powerful Quincy, there is no difference between Reishi and Reiryoku as a source of power. The ability to manipulate such energy allows for a variety of abilities offensive, defensive and supportive.\n\nSpirit Weapon: The weapon that Quincy create by gathering the Reishi in the air.[5] The only limit to a Quincy's ability to create and fire arrows is their own stamina and ability to absorb ambient Reishi.\n\nEnhanced Physical Capabilities: Like Shinigami, Quincy are far more physically capable than regular Humans. For example, given the right environment, they can live much longer lifespans. Two such Quincy, Bazz-B and Jugram Haschwalth, have been a part of the Wandenreich for 1,000 years due to accumulating their power within the \"shadows\" of Seireitei before the Wandenreich once again declared war on the Shinigami. Bazz-B is also particularly strong and durable, being able to casually crush skulls and survive a combined Shikai assault almost completely unharmed.\n\nSpiritual Awareness: As a spiritual being, the Quincy can sense Hollows and other spiritual beings at a significant distance, and tell in what direction they are in. Quincy have an acute perception of Reiatsu.",

The practitioner uses a spray can to paint a symbol resembling a \"C\" within a larger \"C\" centered around a straight line with another line running perpendicular to it near the end connected to a circle around the other symbols in the air above their target, allowing them to unleash a massive amount of ooze over the area underneath it that forms the phrase \"JUST CHOKE YOU\" on the outside; this restrains the target and forces them to endure the brunt of any attacks they unleash, but can still be destroyed by an attack of sufficient power.",

While their former obsession often becomes their first target, most Hollows will eventually become mindless creatures concerned only with finding the most potent souls to devour. Stronger and more evil Hollows are often able to retain some of their intelligence in Hollow form, making them more dangerous than the average Hollow. While most Hollows are evil, or at the very least mindless, at least a few are not, as is the case with Nel Tu and her Hollow companions. They are at least partly capable of camaraderie and loyalty, as seen with Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez and his companions while they were still Hollows when Grimmjow's subordinates voluntarily sacrificed parts of their bodies for the sake of Grimmjow's growth.",

These cannibal Hollows are attracted to one another, and a mass inter-devouring follows, resulting in a Gillian. Following this transformation, the Gillian can evolve twice more, first into an Adjuchas and finally into a Vasto Lorde, provided certain conditions are met. Menos evolution is not only contingent upon the Menos eating other Hollows, but also upon the Menos' ability to avoid being eaten. If another Hollow succeeds in devouring even a part of their body, evolution becomes impossible for the one who was wounded this way. Menos-class Hollows are considered so dangerous Soul Society sends only highly trained Shinigami teams to handle them. These incursions seem to be rare, however, as Menos rarely leave Hueco Mundo unless attracted by large sources of spiritual power or encouraged to by other forces. There are three categories of Menos: Gillian, Adjuchas, and Vasto Lorde.",

There have been Arrancar who have claimed that they gave up their Humanoid forms in order to obtain enormous power. All Arrancar retain a hole in them somewhere, as well as fragments of their Hollow form (in the shape of protrusions and partial masks). A number of Arrancar have tried to conceal the remnants of their past whilst others choose to hide their faces completely to escape unwanted attention. Most also have a colored marking of some sort on their face, although some only gain these markings upon the release of their Zanpakut\u014d (Ex: Nnoitra, Szayelaporro, and Harribel). A few cases that include visible markings without the release of a Zanpakut\u014d include Ulquiorra's tear marks, Sung-Sun's pink dots, the dashes under Grimmjow's eyes, the marking which runs across Nelliel's cheekbones and nose, and the marks on Yammy's cheek bones.",

They often take on a form closer to a Hollow than a Human after performing Resurrecci\u00f3n. Arrancar can partially transform their bodies without fully releasing their Zanpakut\u014d. When Resurrecci\u00f3n is completed, the Arrancar's prior injuries are healed. The only time they can return to their humanoid form is when they reseal their powers in sword form. Changing their form without resealing their powers in a sword is the same as burning off an arm, and if they were to discard part of their released form, while in it, they can never return to normal again.[6] When deactivated due to the user being too injured to sustain it any longer, however, the Resurrecci\u00f3n form simply dissipates as the user's Zanpakut\u014d rematerializes, akin to a Shinigami and their Bankai. Upon losing consciousness, Resurrecci\u00f3n is deactivated and the Zanpakut\u014d is reconstituted.[8][9] If the Zanpakut\u014d is broken, Resurrecci\u00f3n cannot be activated.",

This affinity can be defined by one\u2019s love for the object in question, or simply by an overall fondness for it. This power is usually awakened through a strong emotion associated with the object, such as pride. Using this affinity, Fullbringers pull out the object\u2019s soul and boost it with their own, transforming it in the process. For example, K\u016bgo Ginj\u014d can change the saltire pendant on his necklace into a large claymore. While Fullbringers typically have an affinity with one such object, it is possible to have many. While all Fullbrings are unique, they can be defined by different types. For example, Fullbrings that shroud their users with their power are called Clad-Type Fullbrings.",

Barriers are protective in nature, and can be as simple as a barrier only protecting one direction or encompassing all sides of an area. Barriers can be used for containment, and some barriers can be used offensively. Barriers can mask Spiritual Pressure and can make one spiritually and physically invisible. The strength of a barrier is dependent upon the power of the user. Weak barriers are easily breakable, while strong ones can last for centuries. Barriers created by noble blood are said to be unbreakable by those of lesser status. Certain barriers can be placed beforehand and activated later, while others require certain artifacts and time to activate.",

Holding their palms out in front of themselves, the practitioner generates a glowing rectangular box and performs various hand movements to create various root-like extensions in the air, which connect to the glowing rectangle. Placing their hands up to the rectangle, the practitioner activates the spell, causing the root-like extensions to glow and create a network extending out from the rectangle. The spell transmits messages mentally to anyone within an area of the caster's choosing. In addition to reciting the spell, the user must draw specific markings on their arms, which are animated by the spell, to convey the messages. The messages can be spoken either by the caster or by another within the vicinity of the caster.\n\nIf the intended is not familiar with the caster's reiatsu, they'll be unable to hear the message. Regardless of this, someone that skilled enough at sensing reiatsu can tell from the disruptions that this spell is being used. The incantation is: \"Silken net of black and white!

This spell requires two practitioners to function properly. With the individual(s) inside the Kakaku Taih\u014d encased in a cannonball barrier through pouring their Reiryoku into the Reish\u016bkaku, the first practitioner binds the Kakaku Taih\u014d with four ceremonial ropes tied to the edges of the platform and paints a black circle around the base with a large brush before stabbing their sword into the platform and beginning the incantation. As they continue to chant the incantation with two others lending their power, the practitioner wraps a bandage around their arm, which is engulfed in flame, and slams it into the circle, igniting it as the fire splits and travels around the length of the circle in both directions. Once the flames complete their circuits and return to their arm, the practitioner redirects it onto the floor and up the side of the Kakaku Taih\u014d, severing the ceremonial ropes, before concluding the incantation as the cannon fires its occupant(s) high into the air. Once in the air, the cannonball abruptly changes direction and begins hurtling toward the target destination as the other practitioner within begins chanting the second incantation, determining the speed and angle of the cannonball's movement while those present maintain the cannonball's integrity with a steady flow of Reiryoku. Upon completion, the cannonball hits its target with incredible force.",

The second incantation is not fully known, as Ganju Shiba was distracted before he could finish it properly when he and the Ryoka were launching themselves into the Seireitei.

The right hand of the monkey grabs the star! Embraced by the 25 wheels of the sun, the cradle of sand bleeds!\".

It is one of the mid-level Had\u014d spells as well as one of the common spells taught at the Shin'\u014d Academy. It tends to be many Shinigami's default offensive spell, for both those well versed and not well versed in Kid\u014d. However, the spell does not necessarily have to be used for offensive purposes, and can be used as a source of light in dark places. The incantation is: \"Ye lord!

The process physically begins the moment the body dies and the Chain of Fate is broken. The Encroachment usually lasts months or even years, although a special gas exists that can speed up the process to a mere 72 hours. With every cycle of the Encroachment, the furthest link in the chain begins to gnash and chew into itself and the links attached to it. The process cannot be halted by any known means - any attempt to do so would end in a nasty bite.\n\nDuring each cycle, the Plus experiences excruciating pains, the worst of which come with the final cycle which is much more powerful than those before. During this cycle, all the remaining links undergo the Encroachment at once.",

The longer a Plus lingers in the Human World, the more its Chain of Fate erodes by growing small mouths that eat away at itself. This process, called Encroachment, is painful and starts out slow, but the final erosion is much more violent and finally the chain is completely gone and a hole opens in their chest where their heart used to be. At this point, the Soul's body disperses into spirit particles and then reforms nearby as a Hollow. The body usually forms first, followed by the mask. The Hollow's lost heart is its mask and their unique appearance as well as its special abilities. There are other ways to force Hollowfication, such as prying open the hole in a Plus's chest by force, as shown by Don Kanonji.",

As an extension of his ability to distribute pieces of his soul to others, Yhwach can forcibly take the power of other Quincy; 9 years ago, he used this technique to regain his power during his revival. After selecting Quincy whom he deems impure, including those with mixed blood, Yhwach can steal their powers and make them his own. This process is fatal to its victims, particularly those who are already weak. The true nature of Ausw\u00e4hlen, however, is power redistribution; the power of the Quincy deemed to be useless is collected and redistributed to the ones who need it, and those that it is given to are reborn stronger; after being revived, Lille Barro had a weaker form of his Quincy: Vollst\u00e4ndig automatically activated and gained access to the true power of The X-Axis. Yhwach can use Ausw\u00e4hlen to revive fallen Quincy by stealing the powers and life of other Quincy, which he does by engulfing his targets in massive columns of light while his hands glow with light; Quincy targeted in this manner have their powers stolen even if they manage to avoid the light.",

Knowing Bankai gives captains an average of five-to-ten times the strength of Shinigami who are unable to perform it.

This method is seen as being the exceedingly rarest and the least refined of the three. The method is commonly looked down upon by some captains as barbaric and outdated compared to the other refined methods. This method allows one to bypass having the mastery of Bankai or other possible abilities which a captain would otherwise be required to have knowledge of, for it allows no judgment from captains who would require those skills as a prerequisite to join their ranks. Though rare in other Divisions, the Eleventh Division has been set up to exclusively utilize this method, with each captain attaining their rank by killing their predecessor in combat.",

They use these special powers and the benefits of their daily training to act with precision and speed to aid injured comrades. 4th Division administers emergency first aid to injured division members and transports them to the General Emergency Relief Station.",

The 13th Division's organization is peculiar; the Captain (J\u016bshir\u014d Ukitake), due to his weakened health state, firstly gave much of his administrative work to his Lieutenant, Kaien Shiba. After the lieutenant's death, no one was chosen to replace Kaien and administrative duties were assumed by the division's 3rd Seat pair. It is also notable that, until the promotion of Rukia Kuchiki, the 13th Division was the only division that operated with two 3rd Seat officers and no lieutenant.\n\nFollowing Ukitake's death after having Mimihagi ripped out of his body by Yhwach, Rukia Kuchiki was promoted to captain of the division 10 years after Yhwach's death, while Sentar\u014d Kotsubaki and Kiyone Kotetsu were promoted to co-lieutenants. Kiyone Kotetsu was later transferred to the Fourth Division as its lieutenant, leaving the 3rd seat of the division currently unknown.",

Due to the Reishi comprising captains' bodies being too dense with Reiatsu, placing them in the upper three tiers of Spirit Class (Reii), it cannot naturally break down and be reabsorbed by the soil of Soul Society without intervention, with the ceremony supposedly being used to manually enact this phenomenon. However, the truth is that such potent Reishi can never be reabsorbed by Soul Society, and since allowing overly powerful Reishi to linger in Soul Society indefinitely poses a great risk, the true purpose of the ceremony is to cast deceased captains into Hell. Moreover, the format of the ceremony is notably flexible; though the standard practice consists of purifying a normal Hollow in front of a captain's grave in Soul Society, J\u016bshir\u014d Ukitake was successfully cast into Hell after his death when Ichigo Kurosaki and the lieutenants slaughtered several Jigoku no Gaki in the Human World while Ichigo was carrying his Substitute Shinigami Badge, therefore allowing Ukitake to witness it.",

Its operations are executed in absolute secrecy. During an incident one hundred years ago, J\u016bshir\u014d Ukitake noted how rare it was to see anyone from the Kid\u014d Corps, especially the captain. The Kid\u014d Corps is responsible for opening the Senkaimon between the Human World and Soul Society. The Kid\u014d Corps is responsible for releasing the S\u014dkyoku seal during executions.",

However, the transformation is only temporary and demands grave \"compensation\" (daish\u014d): once their time has run out, the clan member in question will regress from a Human into a complete wolf permanently.

The architecture and layout of the central city in Reverse London is similar to that of Front London, and it contains modern technology such as digital monitors and escalators.[15] However, Reverse London also contains large swaths of farmland and nature, in contrast to Front London's entirely urban layout; this is used at least in part for Dragons to live in for domestication purposes. The residents of Reverse London make use of the Dragons they protect to produce resources like food and minerals for use in their everyday lives. In the year 1609, Wing Bind issued the Dragon Contact Prohibition, prohibiting citizens of Reverse London from making contact with Dragons on penalty of a 100 year prison sentence or execution.",

It contains hundreds of buildings built in a modern brickwork style, including clock towers and ornate churches, as well as large palaces. The streets are rather narrow, with several back alleys, but are adorned with trees. It also contains classical phone booths. Normally, residents of Front London are unable to see Dragons and thus cannot protect themselves from these creatures; however, Balgo Parks gained the ability to do so after living with Shelby for 10 years and later being bitten by him, and occasionally residents of Front London are born with significantly strong magical abilities, allowing them to see Dragons naturally; these individuals are known as Watchers ( \"Those who can see Dragons\"). In the 1800s, London drastically cleaned up its streets, indirectly reducing the population of Disguiser Dragons by removing many of the corpses they could have inhabited.",

            "content": "Longevity: Shinigami can live for far longer and likewise age much slower than Humans. Byakuya Kuchiki, one of the youngest current Gotei 13 captains, appeared to be a teenager 110 years before the White Invasion. When Rukia Kuchiki first met Ichigo Kurosaki, she stated to be at least 160 years old. Shunsui Ky\u014draku, J\u016bshir\u014d Ukitake, and Kenpachi Zaraki are hundreds of years old,Retsu Unohana is over 1,000 years old, and Ch\u014djir\u014d Sasakibe, \u014cetsu Nimaiya, and Ichib\u0113 Hy\u014dsube have lived for over 2,000 years. Despite all their immense ages, they still appear and perform in their prime. Genry\u016bsai Shigekuni Yamamoto, the oldest known Shinigami, was middle-aged when he was still an instructor at the Shin'\u014d Academy 2,100 years before the White Invasion and hundreds of years before the Quincy Blood War.\n\nEnhanced Durability and Endurance: While Shinigami can be injured and killed like regular Humans, it takes considerably more attack power and greater injuries to kill a Shinigami than it would to kill Humans. Some Shinigami have sustained multiple slash and stab wounds, completely ignored dismemberment, and even survived horizontal bifurcation with treatment. Decapitation is the only guaranteed method of outright killing a Shinigami.\n\nReiryoku: Shinigami naturally possess high levels of Spiritual Power, which varies greatly in magnitude with the strength of a Shinigami. The more power a Shinigami has, the sharper their movements will be.[31] A consequence of having Spiritual Power is that unlike powerless spirits, Shinigami need to eat.\nReiatsu: Reiatsu is the pressure exerted from a Shinigami's Reiryoku, and is used for their various techniques. The Reiatsu of a Shinigami will continue to flow for as long as the heart is still beating; if the heart beats, it is impossible for the Reiatsu to cease. Due to this, prisoners, such as Aizen, who cannot have their heart stopped by any executioner in Soul Society are kept in Muken.\n\nZanpakut\u014d: A Shinigami weapon, its shape is typically similar to a Japanese katana. Low ranking officers are issued an Asauchi sword, but high-ranking officers arm themselves with unique swords generated from their own souls. A Zanpakut\u014d is a physical manifestation of this force concentrated into a blade. All Shinigami have a Zanpakut\u014d, but not all of them carry one with them. Its shape differs depending on its owner.",

Nelliel lives in Hueco Mundo with her adoptive brothers and former Fracci\u00f3n, Dondochakka Birstanne and Pesche Guatiche, and their pet, Bawabawa.\n\nHer true form is that of a tall, fully-grown curvaceous and well-endowed adult with long waving green hair. Notably, she has a scar and the crimson line that runs across her face, and pronounced lower canine teeth. Her gown is now torn into a skirt and a top, connected with a single strip across her abdomen. Her skull mask also differs slightly; its features appearing sharper and less cartoonish with a pair of curved horns, but still missing some of its teeth. A large \"3\" is tattooed on her back, indicating that she was the former 3rd Espada.\n\nIn her true adult form, she is much more mature, composed, logical, sophisticated, and intelligent than her child form. She is also relatively level-headed in terms of how to fight, stating that if one's excuse for a battle is to fight out of hatred, prejudice, or simple competition, as Nnoitra does, then it is merely instinctual and animalistic, and that it makes the challenger look \"childish,\" \"unworthy,\" and \"not much of a warrior\"",

After viciously amputating the majority of their left arms, the three Arrancar combine these severed limbs to produce a creature of monstrous proportions named Ayon. This creature towers over average-size combatants and boasts considerable offensive abilities, possessing both inhuman endurance and immense physical strength. Despite some very limited sentience, Ayon is apparently ignorant to its creators' instructions. However, it does express a small amount of concern to their current conditions, only evidenced after they were severely injured.\n\nAyon's appearance is an amalgamation of elements taken from each Arrancar's appropriately themed Resurrecci\u00f3n. These include a deer-skull for a nose, cloven-hoofed legs, a massive muscular torso, a long black mane, and a large serpent for a tail.\n\nWhile this technique could originally only be performed once Mila Rose, Apacci, and Sung-Sun had each entered their respective Resurrecci\u00f3n, in the time since S\u014dsuke Aizen's defeat and the ability's next use, they have gained the ability to execute it in the same manner even within their sealed forms.",

Rickenbacker can teleport to Bruno's location in a flurry of dark energy when his name is called, damaging the immediate surroundings, and is durable enough to simply smash through protective barriers like Cloth.",

In the case of success, the person normally obtains around half of the Shinigami's power, and only temporarily at that. The transferral of a Shinigami's powers to a Human is forbidden by the Soul Society\n\nIn the case of the individual borrowing the power being a Human, several difficulties arise, illustrated by the example of Ichigo. In order to be able to fight as a Shinigami, he has to leave his body and get into soul state, which can only be by use of a Gokon Tekk\u014d or Soul Candy. In the former case, his body needs to be taken care of until he finishes his job and re-enters it.",

Because each individual member of the Royal Guard possesses vast levels of Reiryoku, they can destabilize the three worlds by themselves should they unleash it all without restraint. Therefore, Kirio Hikifune, Senjumaru Shutara, Tenjir\u014d Kirinji, and \u014cetsu Nimaiya normally use each other's lives as seals to prevent their true power from being released; this also prevents them from being able to use their Bankai. To unlock this seal, three of the members have to take their own lives in order to enable the lone survivor to use their full power.",

It comes in elements such as 'wind' or 'lightning'. It is an ultra-powerful technique in which one drives Kid\u014d into one's arms and legs. The Kid\u014d itself can be controlled and fired at opponents from the body. Shunk\u014d was first shown being used by Captain Su\u00ec-F\u0113ng in her fight against her old master, Yoruichi Shih\u014din. Su\u00ec-F\u0113ng states she invented the technique of combining Kid\u014d and Hakuda so recently she had no experience with it in battle, let alone enough time to give it a name. Yoruichi, however, reveals Shunk\u014d is the technique's name, and she invented and learned the ability long before Su\u00ec-F\u0113ng. The keisen uniform has no back or sleeves because the fabric will rip apart when the user's back and arms are filled with Kid\u014d. Though Yoruichi's Shunk\u014d is perfected, she still has difficulties controlling it. The uniform worn when punishment is carried out is specifically geared for Shunk\u014d. By concentrating Shunk\u014d around a particular area of their body, a practitioner can prevent attacks from damaging or piercing this area.",

They investigate, apprehend, and keep these individuals sealed away from the rest of Soul Society within the Special Underground Detention Facility, aka. the Nest of Maggots.

The vast darkness gives the illusion that it stretches on infinitely. Under normal circumstances, non-criminals are not permitted entrance, but Retsu Unohana managed to gain permission from Captain-Commander Shunsui Ky\u014draku to use the location as a battlefield to train Kenpachi Zaraki in Zanjutsu. Muken is reserved for criminals whose heart cannot be stopped by any means by executioners (i.e. those who are immortal).\n\nWhen Shunsui went to visit Aizen in request for his assistance against the Wandenreich, he had the key to Muken sealed into his chest; if he were killed, the gates to the outside world would be sealed off, preventing Aizen's escape. Aizen himself is bound by seals in the form of black straps, which could be undone by nineteen keyholes on the ground; Shunsui was given permission to use up to three keys.",
