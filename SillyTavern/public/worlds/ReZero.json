It happens when a magic user doesn't maintain a proper release cycle to let off excess mana from their Od which causes it to overflow from beyond their bodies. It can have drastic effects on the person such as mana poisoning, and it can even affect the environment. The mana will eventually burst out of and damage their gate if it's not forcibly released.",

As long as he has his feet on the ground, Garfiel can freely manipulate the sediment under him, manipulating the earth's shape at will. He can cause the earth to cave in with a single step, reduce the effects of Earth Magic, and accelerate the recovery of wounds and stamina.\n\nBeastification: Calling back on his ancestral Demi-Human blood, Garfiel transforms himself into a towering, 12 feet long golden tiger with massive and thick limbs, as well as razor-sharp fangs and claws, which can easily rip a man or even a fully grown Earth Dragons in two with a single swipe. Naturally, Garfiel's physical strength in his tiger form increases exponentially, although his speed suffers a reduction due to his size increase. When in this form, he can easily deal devastating attacks and decimate entire areas, but with a cost of losing his reason, making him avoid it if possible.\n\nFlowing Battle: Garfiel has a very wild combat-style, which relies on instinct and his superior physique rather than finesse to perform maneuvers only he can do. In addition to his natural strength, Garfiel is able to hone his skills in melee combat over the years despite his isolated upbringing. It was revealed that the secret behind Garfiel's strength is an old book about Reid Astrea. In that book, an unknown person described Reid's training in detail. Garfiel took the training regime to heart and spent his entire childhood training like Reid. Interestingly enough, the training primarily consists of hand-to-hand combat, without any weapons whatsoever. He spent years replicating the training that Astrea put himself through, honing himself into a skilled unarmed combatant whose savage fighting style revolves primarily around instinct and is therefore difficult to analyse. His training matched with his power makea him a combative prodigy who, by his early teens, was capable of duelling legendary fighters\n\nInhuman strength and speed: Due to his Demi-Human blood, Garfiel is extremely strong. In his normal human form, the physical power displayed by Garfiel far exceed that of an ordinary person. He's fully capable of stopping a Wagpig's destructive attack and even lift it up, despite it weighting multiple tons, as well as punching down fully grown trees without much effort. His Demi-Human blood also allows him to move at speeds greater than an average human, outmaneuvering most foes and easily jumping over trees and multi-story buildings.\nEnhanced Sense of Smell: The potency of his sense of smell is also far greater than a regular human's. He can distinguish the scents of separate individuals from a considerable distance.",

            "content": "Clairvoyance: A secret art passed down through generations in the Oni tribe. It enables her to synchronize with the vision of those who have the same wavelength, allowing her to overlap her vision with another being. While she's usually able to synchronize her vision with anyone she wishes to, there are a few exceptions, one of which being \"high-ranking\" individuals such as Roswaal.\n\nRam is able to use Wind Magic and is relatively skilled in it. When she still had her horn, Ram's wind magic was incredibly more powerful than it is now.\n\nFura: Fura is Ram's most used Wind Magic. Ram shoots wind slashes with a super high speed that can cut through wood, stone, and flesh with ease.\nEl Fura: Ram unleashes a blade of wind, travelling at maximum velocity. It is noted that the attack can't be physically countered.\nUI Fura: Ram is capable of rewriting the world around her, transforming the air around her into blades of wind, which are sent hurling towards her enemies. The blades travel sporadically and without a set course, turning their target into minced meat.\nAl Fura: Ram unleashes an extremely devastating torrent of wind blades that destroy everything and everyone in its path. The unleashed wind blades are described as having the force of a gigantic dragon and the sharpness of a treasured sword. People who are hit with this spell immediately have their eardrums destroyed, their entire bodies slashed to pieces, and, at the end, not even a pool of blood is left of them.\n\nSynesthesia: An ability that she shares with her sister. It allows them to share their feelings and emotions with each other through telepathy. Ram is even able to borrow Rem's horn and use it to greatly amplify her own fighting strength.\n\nOni Bloodline: Ram was formerly considered to be a child prodigy and the second coming of the Oni God even though she only had one horn. However it was cut off by Faust when the Witch Cult attacked her village. Despite not having a horn, she can still go into her Oni Form, being able to use her powers to greatly boost her combat abilities for a short amount of time, but at a cost of vomiting blood and rendering herself unable to move for a long period of time. It is stated that she manages this form in terms of \"Shackles\", with each shackle representing around 10% of her power as an Oni.\n\nMartial Arts: Ram is very skilled at hand-to-hand combat and has an exceptional awareness of her own body's limits. Her knee kicks and elbow punches are capable of shattering bones and rupturing internal organs. She displays her true strength by cladding herself with Wind Magic and combining that with martial arts in which she is able to amplify the speed and direction of her attacks, as well as cut through foes easily with wind from her limbs.\n\nIntelligence: Aside from her combative abilities, Ram is incredibly intelligent. Having received a formal education thanks to the patronage of Mathers, both Ram and Rem excelled academically. She has excellent observational skills and is a strong judge of character.",

While manifesting the horn, vibrant pink energy exudes from Rem's forehead. Despite appearing to not have a physical form, the horn still acts like a physical part of the body. While manifested, an Oni's horns would awaken their instincts and act as a gate that allowed the Oni to absorb mana from the atmosphere, significantly increasing its ferocity and physical abilities. As a twin, Rem was born with a single horn that appeared smaller than an average demon's, meaning her power in her Oni state was lower than her kin's. \n\nRem can smell the Witch's Scent, something that only a few individuals are capable of doing.",
