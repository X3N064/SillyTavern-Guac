It looks similar to Salamence when they undergo Mega Evolution, but it's unclear if there is any connection. It's said that Roaring Moon scatters feathers as it flies around at high speeds seeking prey.

Its head spikes outward twice from both sides and is covered by a green curved piece resembling hair with two cone-shaped structures at the back of its head, and a teal head crest, somewhat akin to a gladiator's helmet. A hollow magenta core serves as a centerpiece on its chest. Five petal-shaped white and green guards tinged with magenta at the ends adorn its torso, resembling a dress.\nAccording to an article from an April issue of Occulture magazine, Iron Valiant's name is borrowed from that of an object described in the Violet Book. An unproven theory claims that it is a robot built as the product of a mad scientist's efforts to create the most powerful psychic Pok\u00e9mon. According to eyewitnesses, Iron Valiant is similar in appearance to both Gardevoir and Gallade. It is also said to be a cruel Pok\u00e9mon, willing to take its shining blade and cut down anyone confronting it without hesitation.

Its long legs are black in the front and white in the back, and its two-toed feet each have two green leaves sprouting between the toes. Its torso is mostly covered by a large, green, multicolored cloak-like structure that extends from a stem on top of its head. This cloak frames its face with a large, black, thorny vine, the two uppermost thorns resembling horns. While the cloak's sleeves move as if Ogerpon has arms beneath them, it actually has no arms or even shoulders; the cloak itself is prehensile and serves as its arms, with the \"sleeves\" able to grasp and manipulate objects. Ogerpon has an orange face, yellow eyes with white, star-shaped pupils and small green leaves at the edges that loosely resemble eyelashes, a three-pointed leaf that serves as hair, small black markings on its eyebrows and cheeks, and two pointed fangs in its upper jaw. Its face is usually hidden behind a mask, and in battle, it wields a large, spiky cudgel wrapped in ivy; these tools are stored under its cloak when not in use. Ogerpon is a female-only species with no male counterpart.\nIt is a mischievous and curious Pok\u00e9mon that enjoys spending time with humans while wearing a mask to blend in. It fights by confusing its opponents with its nimble movements and kicks, and it draws type-based energy from its masks, imbuing its cudgel with different elements. Ogerpon becomes weaker if its masks are taken away, and its full power can be restored to it by returning its masks. This species is known to have a very long lifespan; one specimen is confirmed to have been alive for hundreds of years. \nType (teal mask): grass\nType (wellspring mask): grass,water\nType (hearthflame mask): grass,fire\nType (cornerstone mask): grass,rock\nAbilities(teal mask): defiant\nAbilities(wellspring mask): water absorb\nAbilities(hearthflame mask): mold breaker\nAbilities(cornerstone mask): sturdy\nAbilities(terastallized): embody aspect\nHeight: 1.2m\nWeight: 39.8kg",

On top of its relatively small head is a straight spike. Running down either side of its neck are three black dots, similar to gills. Its lower body is a pattern of blue and pink, diamond-shaped scales outlined with black. The tail consists of four large, blue fins with pink ovals in their centers.

Three pointed teeth jut out the bottom of either side of its jaws, which are frozen shut by the ice covering its head. Its long, gray neck has lines running around its whole body, legs, arms, and tail. It has two arms, each with its own claw, and each arm is jointed together from its oddly shaped blue wings. Each wing has two spikes of ice. The ice covering the wings can break, revealing gray tendril-like appendages on Kyurem's back. The right side of its body seems to be damaged in some way, as the wing and horn on its head on that side are shorter; the right side of its head also has a spiked edge near its jaw hinge that is absent from its left.

It has a long, conical snout with a white tip, a spherical pink nose, and large dark eyes with pinkish pupils. Its front flippers are much longer than its tail flippers, although both have white tips. There are three digits on the front flippers.\nType: water\nAbilities: torrent,liquid voice\nHeight: 0.6m\nWeight: 17.5kg",

Garganacl's shoulders comprise tall three-stepped structures made up of blocks of white rock salt, below which its arms connect to. These stepped structures completely cover Garganacl's head from the sides. A taller block of salt is also present behind Garganacl's head.\nGarganacl's arms and legs are rugged and blocky, and they are similar in appearance and length, with the arms reaching close to the ground due to their location on the body. The upper limbs are dark brown at the base, while the forelimbs are decorated in stripes of lighter brown, before ending in white. Garganacl's hands have three fingers each. Garganacl's torso is really short in comparison to its limbs; it is brown and about as large as its head, with a white block of rock salt on the pelvic area that its legs connect to.

On Revavroom's sides are eight cylinders, each one tipped with a purple stain. The two longest cylinders reach out towards the back and flare out at the ends; these cylinders function as the Pok\u00e9mon's exhaust. The remaining six cylinders sit on top of the two long cylinders, with three on each one.\nRevavroom's large, cylindrical mouth is located on top of its body, and resembles air filters found on muscle car engines. This mouth has jagged serrations resembling teeth and contains a long tongue, which Revavroom uses to unleash toxic fluids. The top and bottom halves of the mouth do not connect with each other.\nRevavroom typically attaches itself to rocks that resemble the wheels and the body of a wagon, which it uses as a means of locomotion. It can create gas by combining the minerals in the rocks with its poison. The gas is then detonated in its cylinders to generate energy for itself. This aggressive Pok\u00e9mon uses the sounds of its exhaust to threaten foes. Revavroom typically levitates and flies around in the air instead of moving on the ground.

All forms share the same basic physiology, with two large eyes, long pectoral fins, a wavy dorsal fin, and a split tail fin. All forms also have a white throat sac, which resembles a bed of rice when inflated; Tatsugiri inflates its throat sac to camouflage itself. The major difference between each form of Tatsugiri is its colors and the poses it makes. Curly Form Tatsugiri is orange with darker orange splotches all over its body and a white underbelly, and it often assumes an upcurled stance. Droopy Form Tatsugiri is mostly a pinkish-red, with white colorations on its belly and fins; true to its name, it tends to droop on its throat sac. Stretchy Form Tatsugiri is a solid yellow, except for its white throat sac; it assumes a straight, horizontal pose. It is said that Tatsugiri's various forms are an adaptation to suit the preferences of its prey.\nType: dragon,water\nAbilities: commander,storm drain\nHeight: 0.3m\nWeight: 8.0kg",

Its primitive appearance and savage nature have prompted rumors that it could be a Jigglypuff from 1,000,000,000 years ago.

Unlike Magneton, each eye blinks independently of one another and not in unison. The top unit bears markings similar to tribal war paint as well as iron filings on its body and horseshoe magnets that resemble hair. The bottom units have only a single magnet each, which is elongated in a manner that makes them resemble legs; they are also covered with iron filings on their ends. Instead of floating like Magneton, it walks by bending these magnets. A series of screws with iron filings on the end floats between the two lower units, making it resemble a tail.\nAccording to an article from a July issue of Occulture magazine, some scientists claim that Sandy Shocks is a Magneton that has lived for 10,000 years. It has allegedly been sighted numerous times in Paldea's more arid regions, but there are no reports of it ever having been caught. It is said to have an aggressive disposition and some people who have seen it claim to have been attacked.

            "content": "Iron Hands is a large, bulky cyborg Pok\u00e9mon that looks like a futuristic sumo wrestler. The head crest is a deep blue with ten black lines connecting across it. The head is light grey with cylinder-like ears. The two eyes are yellow within a black faceplate. The upper half of their body is colored light gray resembling a light armor gear with two bright yellow holes with white spots on each side of where the shoulder would be. Also connected to it is a grey belt with three yellow square armor-like pieces on each side with white spots as well. The lower half is grey with several black line markings. The half-sphere legs are colored dark blue which are connected to small yellow rectangles with white spots. The black feet are shaped like shoes with one small, yellow rectangle with white spots connected to each foot. It has two giant, three-fingered hands which it uses. The back side of their hands is light grey with a yellow circle in the center with three white spots each. The front is four large, bright yellow rectangles connected and black lines. The rectangles also have several white spots as well.\nAccording to an article from a May issue of Occulture magazine, Iron Hands got its name from an iron-handed entity described in the Violet Book. It is said to have fists that move independently of its body and to be capable of throwing large, fast-moving vehicles. An unproven theory claims that Iron Hands was once an athlete who became mortally wounded but was kept alive by being made into a cyborg. It strongly resembles Hariyama, though why this is remains unanswered. While asleep, it turns itself off, connecting its hands to its body and causing the energy on its palms and armor pieces to disappear, making them black.\nType: fighting,electric\nAbilities: quark drive\nHeight: 1.8m\nWeight: 380.7kg",

Its body is primarily dark blue, with black armor plating resembling fur covering its necks and shoulders. The inner armor surrounding its head is fuchsia in color with white spots and resembles collars. The surfaces of Iron Jugulis' heads function as LED displays. When turned on, each of its heads glows blue with black eyes; the main head additionally has fuchsia pupils and visible pointed teeth formed from its armor plates. Like with the eyes of other future Paradox Pok\u00e9mon, Iron Jugulis' LED faces are used to display its emotions; unlike with Hydreigon, its secondary heads can emote in this manner as well. Its abdomen has two fuchsia stripes and its feet resemble fins. Its tail also sports a fuchsia stripe and ends with a black plate.\nAn article from a July issue of Occulture magazine describes Iron Jugulis as a flying life-form resembling Hydreigon that has allegedly been seen in a certain corner of Paldea. It was reported to have razed an entire building with a high-energy blast before flying off as if to find its next objective. Iron Jugulis is theorized to be a sort of machine-Hydreigon hybrid, as it combines Hydreigon's ferocity with the ruthlessness of a machine. It is said that it takes its name from a similarly described entity in the Violet Book. It was shown to be capable of sending its arms flying by themselves independently of its body. While asleep, it turns itself off, causing the energy on its heads, neck plates, underbelly and tail to disappear, making them black.\nType: dark,flying\nAbilities: quark drive\nHeight: 1.3m\nWeight: 111.0kg",

It has four small \"feet\", red compound eyes, red horns on the sides of its head, and white armor plating covering its thorax. Its abdomen is black and light blue with two black diamond spots on the outside. It has six diamond-shaped wings that are mostly orange with white speckles and a single black triangle marking, which levitate a short distance away from its body.\nIn an article from an August issue of Occulture magazine, it is said that the name Iron Moth was borrowed from that of a flying object described in the Violet Book. Iron Moth is said to resemble Volcarona, and it would descend from the skies, following people around and occasionally attacking them. Some point to Iron Moth's aggression as evidence supporting that it may be a UFO controlled by alien life. It is speculated that something out there may be using Iron Moth to observe the people of the Pok\u00e9mon world in preparation for an invasion. In the TCG, it was shown to be capable of sending its \"legs\" flying by themselves independently of its body. It has been seen releasing attacks from its connected wings like a cannon. While asleep, it turns itself off, connecting its wings to its back and causing the energy on its wings to disappear, making them black.\nType: fire,poison\nAbilities: quark drive\nHeight: 1.2m\nWeight: 36.0kg",

When Chest Form Gimmighoul senses an approaching person or Pok\u00e9mon, it will use ghost energy to possess its target and force them to collect Gimmighoul Coins. It tends to hide in less frequented places such as warehouses and shop corners to ambush people and Pok\u00e9mon, and its control has notable persistence; one old tale tells of a Gimmighoul who manipulated a young girl to gather 999 coins to fill its chest. It is also known to drain the life out of anyone who attempts to steal its coins. When Gimmighoul has gathered 999 of the coins, it is able to evolve into Gholdengo. Chest Form Gimmighoul was said to have been born inside its chest 1,500 years ago. Chest Form Gimmighoul can live in a variety of different areas in Paldea, such as ancient ruins, watchtowers, and secluded islands in the Paldean Sea.\nRoaming Form Gimmighoul is among the smallest and lightest of all Pok\u00e9mon, and is created from coins infused with passion. In its Roaming Form, Gimmighoul is extremely timid, running away and dropping its coin as soon as anyone approaches. It does not manipulate people and Pok\u00e9mon to give it coins like its Chest Form counterpart; instead, it is able to gather coins by itself. Despite being found everywhere in Paldea, no one has apparently been able to capture Roaming Form Gimmighoul. It constantly wanders, believed to be searching for the chest it used to live in.\nType: ghost\nAbilities (chest form): rattled\nAbilities (roaming form): run away\nHeight (chest form): 0.3m\nHeight (roaming form): 0.1m\nWeight (chest form): 5.0kg\nWeight (roaming form): 0.1kg",
