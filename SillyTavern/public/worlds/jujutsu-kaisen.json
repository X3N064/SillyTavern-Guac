            "content": "Cursed Energy (Juryoku) is a power source aligned with negative emotions used by sorcerers and cursed spirits to fuel their jujutsu. Negative emotions such as grief and anger are the foundation of cursed energy. These emotions exist to some degree within most humans and as a result, the vast majority of human beings possess cursed energy. If this amount is higher than a certain degree, it grants the person the ability to see cursed spirits. These individuals are known as jujutsu sorcerers and they are very rare among the human race. Cursed energy leaks from the human body, accumulates, and ferments over time until a cursed spirit manifests. This is only the case with non-sorcerers, as sorcerers are trained to control and channel their cursed energy into jujutsu.",

When applied to their fighting techniques, it can grant them a special texture or effect that gives them an advantage in battle. These special traits cannot be defended by simple reinforcement techniques. Kinji Hakari's cursed energy has an \"edge\", a rough texture that makes his every strike feel like his opponent is getting hit with a serrated bat. Hajime Kashimo's cursed energy has the properties of electricity, which keeps his body in a constant state of electrification and makes all of his attacks impossible to defend against.\n\nHowever, extreme amounts of cursed energy output can allow someone to mostly ignore these effects. Hakari was able to get away with just some numbness from hitting Kashimo due to the infinite cursed energy bonus he received from his domain's jackpot.",

Blood Manipulation is a cursed technique that allows the user to control and shape their blood beyond its natural form or motion for a variety of effects. It can be used to manipulate every aspect of the user's blood, including blood composition, plasma, and red blood cells. Internal and external blood can be utilized as long as it belongs to the user.\n\nBlood can be manipulated in a variety of ways utilizing this technique. External blood can be hardened or shaped to create mid-range projectiles. Internal blood can be used to control one's own pulse rate and body temperature, effectively giving themselves more energy to increase their physical capabilities.\n\nAs with any cursed technique, Blood Manipulation's efficiency and strength depend on the user. Noritoshi's Piercing Blood was unable to harm Hanami while Choso's was able to severely injure Yuji. External blood can also be nullified under specific circumstances where the amount of water in the area renders blood unable to hold any shape.\n\nThe user is also limited by the amount of their own blood they have access to. Too much blood loss could obviously result in death, so users generally prepare blood bags or weapons dipped in their blood in advance.",

The original soul is usually supressed and dominated, leaving no trace of the original person but instead the reincarnated soul. The individual who reincarnates retains every memory from the previous soul, so for example a person who reincarnates from ancient times into a modern day civilian will not be confused or out of place because they have the memories and experiences of the modern day civilian.",

Innate domains serve as the foundation of an innate cursed technique, but sorcerers, non-sorcerers and cursed spirits are born with them. An individual is born with an innate domain which exists as a metaphysical space that reflects their mind and soul. Innate domains can only be physically constructed or \"expanded\" using the most supreme technique in all of jujutsu, Domain Expansion. This technique uses a barrier to create a separate space where the innate domain is constructed by cursed energy and imbued with the user's innate technique.\n\nSukuna's mind resides within his innate domain when Yuji Itadori is in control of the vessel. When they were both there at the same time, Sukuna described it as if they were standing within his soul.\n\nDomains expanded using only cursed energy in an enclosed space without a proper barrier are considered incomplete. This is because they don't include a barrier with the user's cursed technique imbued into it. Finger Bearers, cursed spirits that possess high cursed energy without proper cursed techniques, involuntarily generate these types of domains around them.",

Having since given up on the justice system completely, Hiromi currently participates in the Culling Game as one of the top players. He initially serves as an antagonist of the Culling Game Arc before a change of heart leads him to cooperate with Yuji Itadori. Hiromi Higuruma is a man of average height with lightly tanned skin and a slender build. He has short, well-kept, dark-brown hair with a stringy texture that is styled to flow toward the back of his head. Hiromi has a large nose and brown eyes with very small pupils. He almost always has a tired and bored expression on his face due to overwork and the nature of his career. Hiromi is a very relaxed, hyperintelligent, and modest man who always appears very detached and aloof from his environment. He can come off as apathetic due to the weary expression that's always on his face but Hiromi is actually very passionate about justice. Hiromi is constantly working on his craft and his associates think he's a masochist for taking on tough cases where most people would consider his defendants sure to be found guilty.",

Jin loved his son Yuji very much as he dearly wanted to have a child with his partner Kaori. In a flashback, Jin is holding the baby Yuji Itadori and tells his father that if he wants to talk about her, he will just leave. The older man is revealed to be Yuji's grandfather, Wasuke Itadori, who tells Jin that while he can live his life however he pleases, he will die if he doesn't give up on her. Jin tells Wasuke not to say such things in front of Yuji since babies apparently remember more than most believe. Wasuke mentions the fact that Jin wanted a child with a woman named Kaori, but before Wasuke can say something about her death, Kaori with stitches on her forehead interrupts him and addresses him, as her father-in-law, asking what he's talking about.",

This marking is reminiscent to that of a typical thief found in cartoons, and subsequently, the animal it represents, which is the raccoon. Juzo wears a dark-colored apron over his bare chest, dark-colored pants, and equally dark-colored boots with metal tips. Juzo is a very aggressive man who is very openly out of his mind. He's crazy, doesn't follow orders, and desires to only to kill people and use their corpses to make \"hanger racks\". Because cursed spirits don't leave a body behind when they're exorcised, Juzo has no interest at all in them.",

He had black hair tied into a top knot above his head and the majority of his body was obstructed by the bindings of his Heavenly Restriction. His entire body was scarred with grotesquely thin wrinkled skin that he dressed in bandages. His right forearm was missing entirely and both legs were too weak to support his weight beneath the knees. Immobile, Kokichi sat inside a bathtub attached to several tubes inside a remote cave. Following his healing at the hands of Mahito's Idle Transfiguration, Kokichi obtained a healthy body. Only a single scar on his cheek remained and he was able to stand up on his own. Like his Mechamaru stand-in at school, Kokichi donned a normal jujutsu high uniform with a white puffy scarf-like cloth around the collar of it. Kokichi was a reclusive and reserved individual who resented being born without a future outside of the jujutsu world. He proudly admitted he'd give back every ounce of cursed energy to gain a normal body. In order to achieve his dream, Kokichi was willing to engage in a Binding Vow with the enemy in order to gain a healthy body. He leaked information with them but included the conditions that they couldn't hurt his fellow Kyoto students in the contract. Kokichi attempted to kill Mahito and Pseudo-Geto after his body was healed. Fighting desperately to achieve his goal, Kokichi bet everything on his planning and determination. However, his desperation, unfortunately, lead to his demise before he could meet his classmates and Kasumi.",

His group's ultimate goal is the eradication of humanity and ultimately replacing the population with cursed spirits. He is a human-looking cursed spirit with a patchwork face and gray eyes. (In the anime, Mahito possesses heterochromia, as his left eye is dark blue and his right eye is gray.) He has long grayish-blue hair that reaches past his neck and is sectioned off into three large strands with ties at the ends. Along with his face, Mahito has stitches all across his body that give him the appearance that he was sewn together. Mahito is a sadistic, immature cursed spirit who enjoys toying with human emotions. He believes he was born from human transgressions and considers himself the very manifestation of humans' hatred of each other. As such, Mahito believes that humans should be extinguished and cursed spirits should rule in their place.",

Mai looked identical to her twin sister but with her hair cut shorter. She had mid-length black hair (green in the anime) that reached just to her neck, dark brown eyes, and thin eyebrows.\n\nLike her twin sister, Mai was mistreated by the Zenin clan growing up only for being a girl with little talent for jujutsu. Mai was content with living under their thumb as a servant and would rather do chores than fight. In contrast, Maki wanted to spite the clan and work as a sorcerer. The repercussions of Maki's rebellion forced Mai to study to become a jujutsu sorcerer. Mai detested the grotesque work exorcising curses entails and resented Maki for essentially thrusting them both into that life. Mai was an unwilling sorcerer who took out her frustrations on others, mainly her rivals and Maki. She has a snarky and rude personality due to her experiences. She's crude and likes to boost her own ego.",

Daughter of Ogi Zenin and the elder twin sister of Mai Zenin, Maki was born in the Zenin Family.\n\nBorn a non-sorcerer in one of the Big Three Sorcerer Families, Maki was constantly mistreated and felt compelled to expel herself from the Zenin clan. She aspires to be a great jujutsu sorcerer to spite her family, working closely with her friends Panda and Toge Inumaki, while also serving as a role model to the first-year students. Before her awakening she was a young woman with a tall athletic build. She has small golden eyes and long dark green hair normally tied into a short ponytail. She had fringes of hair over her forehead with smaller strands framing her cheeks and used to sport different pairs of glasses that allowed her to see curses. Maki was severely burned by Jogo's flames during the Shibuya Incident. This has left a great deal of her body covered in scars from the severe burns, running all the way up and down both her arms and the sides of her face. Her hair now only reaches just past her ears, which may be a result of her cutting it, or it may have been partially or entirely burned off. And overtime from training while she recovered from her injuries developed a more robust physique than before. During her conflict with the Zenin Family, Maki lost her right eye altogether and now has a scar where it was sliced by her father's katana. She ditched the cape but sports mostly the same outfit, with the same sleeveless shirt paired with the same pants, belt, and shoes. By the time she entered the Culling Game, Maki reclaimed her cape and had her right eye completely healed. Maki is a very headstrong and straightforward person who tries to drive herself forward without needing anyone else's help. She is extremely strong-willed, capable, and motivated to escape the standards that have been set for her by people who are supposed to be her family.",

This appears to be her preferred style while working as a sorcerer. While relaxing or casually playing ping pong, she'll let her hair down or style it into a single braid. Mei Mei is a very calm and relaxed woman who can keep her cool in any situation. While very kind and honest, Mei Mei is very open about being greedy. Monetary value is the most important thing and quite possibly might be the only important thing to her. She considers herself to always on the side of money and doesn't get out of bed for free. Allegiances and politics don't matter to Mei Mei as long as she gets paid for being a sorcerer. She also claims to not understand relationships not based on money.",

            "content": "Miguel was initially one of Suguru Geto's commanders who wished to see him become king. Following the Night Parade of a Hundred Demons, Miguel was forcefully recruited by Satoru Gojo. He returned to his homeland of Africa and the community of sorcerers there to train Yuta Okkotsu. Miguel is a tall, slim, dark-skin, African man whose eyes and hair are both normally covered by accessories. He has thin lips and large ears decorated with hoop earrings. Armless sunglasses cover his eyes and Miguel always wears a large puffy beret-style hat. Miguel also sports a zipped short sleeve jacket, dark pants, and normal shoes as well. While around Yuta, Miguel also wore a patterned hoodie about a year later. Miguel is a relatively calm individual who doesn't appear to openly express any particular disdain for non-sorcerers like most of his former allies. He and Larue simply wished to see Suguru Geto reach his dreams and decided to leave the group after his death. Miguel was loyal to Suguru, willing to take on the world's strongest sorcerer for him. Albeit Miguel did swear to curse Suguru if he ended up dying in that battle.\n\nDespite being nervous and fighting such a powerful opponent, Miguel put on a brave face appeared to remain confident, prompting Satoru to even admit Miguel is a tough opponent. There comes with a light-hearted side to Miguel. The Hasaba sisters felt Miguel was fooling around during the fight and Satoru mentioned that he talks like the MMA comedian Bobby Ologun.\n\nFollowing their battle, Miguel would reluctantly meet Satoru again. Forced to take on Yuta as his protege, Miguel appears to harbor resentment toward Satoru and has no desire to see him. It's also worth mentioning Yuta and Miguel appear to get along well enough despite the latter's role in Suguru's end.",

Most jujutsu sorcerers are born with an innate technique that manifests around the age of five or six, which continually carves its formula into the user over time.\n\nInnate techniques are proprietary and comprise eighty percent of a sorcerer's intrinsic skillset, making them nearly impossible to mimic, not unlike a copyrighted computer program. When an individual refers to their own personal cursed technique, they're generally talking about their innate technique.\n\nIn almost all cases, an individual possesses only a single innate technique. In especially rare cases, someone may possess more than one. Kenjaku, who can switch bodies, has access to the technique carved into the body of his vessel. However, even can only possibly possess a maximum of three to four innate techniques at one time. Yuta Okkotsu can only utilize numerous techniques because Rika serves as his external aid. Otherwise, too many innate techniques will overload the user's brain.",

Naobito has mid-length, gray hair that is usually slicked back to reach just behind his neck. He has small black eyes with long eyebrows with thick edges. Naobito also sports a long, thin, English-style mustache that extends beyond both sides of his cheeks. Naobito is a tempered and aloof individual to a degree where it conflicts with his image as a clan head. Some question his capabilities as the head mainly due to his consistent drinking. Like the majority of the Zenin members, Naobito was raised with traditionalist values and was crafted into an arrogant person who dismisses all those he deems below him, like his own nieces. Naobito naturally clashes with Maki, who opposes him despite having little cursed energy. He threatened to get at Maki through her sister and has used his influence to keep her from being promoted.

He has sharp brown eyes and dyed blonde hair accented with his black roots. He almost always has an arrogant grin plastered across his face and believes himself to have an appearance befitting a clan head, implying he's much better looking than other members like Jinichi. He has three piercings in his left ear, one in his ear lobe, and two more toward the top. Following his reincarnation as a vengeful cursed spirit, Naoya has a much more monstrous appearance befitting a curse. He no longer has a human shape, instead, his body is large and long like a caterpillar. He retains human-like arms but the face of the worm-like body is covered in a mask shaped like a star with six holes. Although barely recognizable, Naoya's human face can protrude from one of these holes. This form was only Naoya's cursed womb state, and he soon evolved. His fully realized cursed form resembles a chrysalis with a skull-shaped face capable of extending tendrils that band together to function like humanoid limbs.",

Noritoshi cut his hair after he was ousted from the Kamo clan into a much shorter and spikier style. He also no longer sports a Jujutsu High uniform. Instead, Noritoshi wears a long-sleeved black shirt underneath a protective breastplate that covers the left side of his chest.

Noritoshi is a calm and stoic person from a complicated family life. He used to feel pressured to uphold the values and ideals of the Kamo family and behaved accordingly. Noritoshi is a leader among his peers other than Todo but the twisted ideals of the conservative faction used to greatly distort Noritoshi's relationships with his fellow sorcerers. Due to Noritoshi's separation from her and his exile from the Kamo clan as well, Noritoshi believed he had nowhere to belong and that he wasn't important to anyone. Without the weight of the Kamo clan on his shoulders, Noritoshi mellowed out and developed a more natural personality true to himself.

He lived over a hundred and fifty years ago when he seemingly conducted research resulting in the Cursed Womb: Death Paintings. Noritoshi Kamo is regarded as the evilest jujutsu sorcerer in history and a stain on the Kamo Family.\n\nKenjaku revealed that he inhabited Noritoshi Kamo's body with his cursed technique, allowing him to swap out the former's brain for his own. Noritoshi, in his original body, was seen to be an older-looking man with short dark hair, worn slicked back, and a small mustache. He had narrow eyes and had a straight, stitched scar running horizontally through his forehead. He wore what appears to be a dark yukata and sported an umbrella. While possessed by Kenjaku, Noritoshi gained a reputation as a cruel man considered both a blot on the Kamo Family and the evilest jujutsu sorcerer to ever live. His experiments during the Meiji Era were so vile all records were destroyed and even the curses that resulted from them, despite having no hatred for humanity, despised him.",

Ogami was an evil self serving old woman who only ever used her talents for herself at the cost of others. She cursed others in order to get paid and live freely, nothing more. As far as generally mannerisms, Ogami hardly speaks or opens her eyes the majority of the time.\n\nLike Jiro, she was upset her freedom to commit crimes was deterred by the presence of Satoru Gojo. Even in her old age, Ogami decided to work together with other curse users to get rid of him and reclaim her prime.\n\nOgami doesn't appear to have any sympathy for others.

While sorcerers who don't come from prominent clans can inherit innate techniques, e.g. Straw Doll Technique, those obtained hereditarily from the ancestors of the Big Three Families especially carry the title of inherited technique, e.g. Limitless. The Big Three Families have maintained their authority and prestige by passing down powerful techniques to their descendants. Therefore, a sorcerer with an inherited technique is guaranteed an important position in the family.\n\nInherited Technique users have the advantage of being equipped with a manual on how to use them.

Orimoto bequeathed the last vestiges of her will to the cursed spirit, symbolizing a manifestation of her love that she left behind to protect Yuta. Rika resembles her time as Orimoto's vengeful spirit but she has several new distinguishing characteristics that are more refined than before. Rika can partially manifest white skull-shaped head with horizontal lines going down it, no eyes, and long teeth. Most of her body is made up of a black mass but she also has two muscular human-like arms with black fingernails that are trimmed and more kept than in the past. Due to the circumstances revolving around her creation, Rika does not have a strong individual ego like Mahito or Jogo. Compared to Naoya Zenin's vengeful spirit, Rika's retention of Orimoto's personality is minor.\n\nRika inherited the last remnants of Orimoto's will and exists to protect Yuta. She communicates with short, direct statements and questions, or by simplying stating Yuta's name. Rika is far less volatile than when she was Orimoto's vengeful spirit and is now completely cooperative with Yuta at all times.",

Her spirit was cursed, transforming her into a powerful special grade vengeful cursed spirit worthy of the moniker \"Queen of Curses\". Rika spent years haunting Yuta as a curse until he attended Tokyo Jujutsu High where he learned to unravel the curse on Rika's spirit, finally allowing her to pass on to the afterlife. Rika was a young human girl with a small fragile frame, long black hair that reached her shoulders, soft eyes, and peach-colored skin. She wore a sleeves black dress with a white collar decorated with hearts and black shoes.\n\nRika's appearance as a vengeful curse was completely different. She was a larger monstrous curse with a large muscular upper body, long arms, and a tail-like shadow that served as her lower body. She had a single cycloptic eye that was normally hidden behind a shell that looks similar to a brain. Extending from her head were several tendrils, and she had long untrimmed fingernails as well as a mouth full of thin sharp teeth. Rika was an innocent young girl and childhood friend of Yuta. She shared a special connection with Yuta and believed that she loved him. These continued on even after death. As a vengeful spirit, Rika desired only to protect Yuta, but her great power often caused her to harm others in the process. While she had curse-like instincts to attack anything that was a threat, Rika still listened to Yuta and restrained herself because of her love for him.\n\nAfter being freed from her curse, Rika was still able to forgive Yuta and leave him behind despite his promise to pass on with her. Before leaving, Rika even told Yuta that she was happier spending time with him as a curse than when she was alive.",

Rin wears a tracksuit with sneakers and a small hat on the top of his head. Rin is an innocent young man compared to other Culling Game players who take advantage of his weakness.

He examined the behavior of the bullies and knew how to avoid getting on their bad side. Rin was content going with the flow so others wouldn't see him as a target and took good things as they came. Yuji however stood up for the student being bullied and beat up the bullies. When Yuji turned to see if Rin also wanted to fight, the latter was simply stricken with fear.\n\nDuring the Culling Game, Rin was too much of a coward to do anything while Hanyu and Haba killed others.

Satoru is the pride of the Gojo Family, the first person to inherit both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in four hundred years. He works as a teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High and uses his influence to protect and train strong young allies. Satoru is a very tall, lean and muscular man who is in his late twenties and is considered relatively attractive, mainly due to his facial features. He has snow-white hair and the Six Eyes, which are a vibrant blue color. Satoru normally covers his eyes with a black blindfold which props up his hair and gives it a spikier appearance. When sporting a more casual look, Satoru will wear sunglasses and let his hair down to reach the base of his neck.\n\nWhile working, Satoru wears a dark blue zip-up jacket with a high collar that's also fairly wide. He wears slim-fit matching black pants and black dress boots. Before switching over to a simple blindfold, Satoru used to wear bandages over his eyes. Satoru enjoys wearing expensive clothing and has a number of casual looks he'll pair with wearing his sunglasses. As a Tokyo Jujutsu High student, Satoru wore the normal school uniform with his sunglasses before adopting any sort of makeshift blindfold.\n\nSatoru is a complex individual. He is normally seen to be nonchalant and playful towards his students, close colleagues, and friends. However, he is unsympathetic and cruel towards sorcerer executives, an example being his blatant disrespect towards Principal Gakuganji, and his enemies.\n\nSatoru is extremely confident in his abilities and reputation as a powerful sorcerer, believing himself to be invincible. His opinion of others often only go as far as his judgement of their strength, and he is quite apathetic towards anyone he deems weak. Additionally, greatly influenced by his own desire for power, he is very arrogant.\n\n",

Shoko is a very laid-back and nonchalant person, especially compared to Kiyotaka Ijichi high-strung attitude and the overly playful Satoru. As a student alongside Satoru and Suguru, she would let the two fight and simply remove herself from the situation as it escalated. She enjoyed poking fun at them like when she called them both trash for Utahime Iori or when she took Satoru's sunglasses and wore them after he was punished by Masamichi Yaga. As the school doctor, Shoko appears to take her job seriously but she's very stoic. While Satoru was upset about Yuji Itadori's demise, Shoko kept her personal feelings out of the situation and only wanted to perform an autopsy, noting that Satoru was being more emotional than usual.

            "content": "Suguru Geto was originally a student of Masamichi Yaga's alongside Satoru Gojo and Shoko Ieiri at Tokyo Jujutsu High. His experiences as a jujutsu sorcerer bred a deep hatred for non-sorcerers, leading to an incident where Suguru massacred over a hundred civilians in a single night. He was expelled from Jujutsu High and came to be known as the worst of all curse users. Suguru is a tall, slim man with long black hair partially tied up behind his head while the rest drapes down his back. He has small black eyes and bangs that occasionally cover the left eye. Suguru Geto hated non-sorcerers, usually referring to them as \"monkeys\". He felt sorcerers are the superior race and humanity's next stage of evolution. He was smug and extremely condescending towards normal humans, using fake personas to lure in vulnerable people who were cursed. Suguru found non-sorcerers disgusting enough to spray himself in order to disinfect the \"monkey stench\". He believed monkeys only have two roles in association with him, money-collecting monkeys and curse-collecting monkeys. If they weren't fulfilling their roles, Suguru would gladly allow curses to kill them without any remorse. In contrast, Suguru cared deeply for his fellow curse users, referring to his commanders as family. Each of them still looks up to Suguru for putting sorcerers as a race first and hoped that he would have become king of the jujutsu world. Suguru was even polite to jujutsu sorcerers, although this was usually expressed under one of his fake personas.",

Regarded as the undisputed King of Curses, Sukuna is one of the primary antagonists in the world of Jujutsu. According to legend, Sukuna was an Imaginary Demon during the Heian Era but in truth he was a sorcerer also known as the Disgraced One. Jujutsu sorcerers of the Golden Age of Jujutsu gave their all against him but ultimately fell one after another. Sukuna existed throughout the ages by transforming into a cursed object after death, a state where he split his power into twenty indestructible fingers. Sukuna was incarnated in June 2018 when Yuji Itadori consumed one of his fingers. Sukuna was trapped inside Yuji's body and was rarely in control until he managed to transfer his soul into the body of Megumi Fushiguro. His past appearance is described as a demon with four arms and two faces. Previously, he used to take the appearance of his former host: Yuji Itadori, but with pink spiked hair slightly pushed upfront and with tattoos/lines on his forehead, nose, cheeks, upper body, and abdomen. He also has a second pair of eyes underneath his normal eyes, which are usually closed. Now, he takes the appearance of his new current host: Megumi Fushiguro, but with uniquely styled black hair with long spikes that jut out in every direction around his head, resembling a sea-urchin and with tattoos/lines on his forehead, nose, cheeks, upper body, and abdomen. He also has a second pair of eyes underneath his normal eyes. Sukuna also has two lines on both his wrists, upper arms, circles on both his shoulders with a dot in each, two-segmented curve lines on his chest, and two lines on his stomach while possessing Yuji/Megumi.",

Takeru is a small anthropomorphic dog-looking cursed corpse with small limbs compared to the rest of his body. He has light body color and wears a simple tie with polka dot pattern and black briefs.\n\nAs a human, he was an energetic young boy with light skin, light spiky short hair and a band aid on his right cheek. He also wore a light shirt with a collar. Takeru is a caring and cheerful cursed corpse who cares deeply for his creator: Masamichi Yaga, with who he seems to have a paternal relationship, as he wanted the rest of the cursed corpses to cheer him up upon seeing him down. He was shown to think of himself as someone intelligent and perceptive, as he proudly asks people about being a genius with a big smile. Given his mother's depression after his death and tears of joy upon being reunited with his cursed corpse, it can be assumed Takeru was a loving son who shared a deep connection with her, which is proved by Atsuya's statement that she couldn't live without his support.",

At one time they were responsible for preaching the foundation of jujutsu sorcerers and ended up spawning religious groups that worship the Star as their deity. Due to the nature of Tengen's role in the jujutsu world, most people have no idea what they look like. Only those granted permission have seen that Tengen does not quite possess the appearance of a typical human being. Tengen has four eyes with a cylinder-shaped head that features no hair at all, but they do possess a bipedal humanoid body. They wear a simple light-colored robe.\n\nAs stated by Tengen, due to Toji Fushiguro killing the previous Star Plasma Vessel 11 years ago and preventing Tengen from merging with her, Tengen's current appearance is the result of them having continued to \"evolve\" past their humanity. Tengen originally possessed a much more human appearance. Tengen appears to be a well-mannered, straightforward, and knowledgeable individual with humanity's best interest in mind. They don't seem to mind awkward questions about their experience and is more than happy to help normal jujutsu sorcerers provided the right situation.",

Even after knowing him for two months, Yuta was still unfamiliar with Toge and intimidated by him. However, Toge is actually a highly insightful and caring individual. He is intelligent and understands the dangers of overwhelming power.\n\nToge chooses not to speak in a conventional manner in order to protect people from his cursed speech.

Toji is a tall, muscular man with mid-length straight black hair that reaches to his ears. His eyes are green, just like his son's, and he has thin black eyebrows and a scar on the corner of his right lip. Toji is a cool-headed, confident man who makes a living using his skills and does not sweat the small stuff. He appears to enjoy insightful conversation with others as long as it somehow pertains to himself and can trade witty banter with the highly sarcastic likes of Satoru Gojo. Toji has a crazed expression as if he's lost in the thrill of the fight, but he's always maintaining a cool and calculated head and plotting his next move. As a non-sorcerer raised in the Zenin family who values cursed techniques above all, Toji is a man who has suffered due to the interests of the sorcerer clans in a very similar manner to Maki Zenin. His evil actions result from his dejection towards the jujutsu world as he attempts to spite it. Born without cursed energy, Toji eventually left the Zenin family and married a woman, taking her name \"Fushiguro\". Her kindness helped Toji change his ways. He stopped gambling and hunting sorcerers and it's likely her influence stopped Toji from taking revenge on the Zenin clan. However, after her death, Toji reverted back to his old, cold, self. Keeping up with his cold persona when Gojo had landed a fatal blow on him and asked for his last words, Toji chose not to utter any final words at first. In his last moments, he thought of his ex-wife and their son, so he decided to tell Satoru that Megumi would be sold into the Zenin family in a few years.",

He has mid-length, disheveled black hair and sharp eyes. Little is known about Negi, but he clearly shares Suguru Geto's vision to eradicate non-sorcerers. He refers to normal humans as monkeys and wants them all to suffer so the strong will thrive while curses fade from existence for good. He would prefer not to kill jujutsu sorcerers in battle but will attack if necessary.\n\nUnlike Mimiko and Nanako, Negi and Manami were willing to allow Pseudo-Geto to exist in order to keep carrying on Suguru's legacy. The Hasaba sisters believe the imposter should die for defiling their master's body, but Negi believes his body is no concern of theirs. Negi only wishes to create the world Suguru envisioned and believes that's what it me",

Yuji is the grandson of Wasuke Itadori who was living a normal life until he encountered Megumi and ate one of Sukuna's fingers. After becoming Sukuna's vessel, Yuji began attending Tokyo Jujutsu High alongside Megumi and Nobara as first-year students. Yuji is a young man of average height and appears to have a slender build when wearing baggy clothing, but actually has a lean and muscular physique. He also has relatively large light brown eyes and spiky pink hair (brownish blonde in the manga) that's styled in an undercut fashion. When becoming the vessel for Sukuna after eating his finger, he gains a second pair of eyes that only open when Sukuna controls his body along with his many markings. He gains a noticeable scar between his two eyes and a smaller scar on his left labial commissure of the mouth during the Shibuya Incident.\n\nHe lost the second pair of eyes that only open when Sukuna controls his body along with his many markings after the latter transferred to Megumi Fushiguro as his new vessel. Yuji is a fair person who truly cares for not only his comrades but anyone he views as people with their own wills, despite how deep or shallow his connection to them is. He highly commends \"the value of life,\" and to this end, he will ensure that others receive a \"proper death\". Because of this, he believes that it is morally unethical for him to take another human life, and tries to avoid any possibility of doing so unless as a last resort.\n\nHe is also not without his more energetic and outgoing traits. Such as his frequent comedic moments where he was seen alongside Nobara gushing about Tokyo and his eagerness to train with Gojo or even when entertaining both Junpei and his mother. One of Yuji's defining traits is his willingness to sacrifice himself for others, triggered by his grandfather's last words to him to die surrounded by others. When he and Megumi were under the threat of being killed by a curse, Yuji impulsively swallowed Sukuna's finger to exorcise the curse and save them despite having met Megumi for the first time on that day.",

            "content": "Yuta Okkotsu was initially a special grade cursed human haunted by his late childhood friend, Rika Orimoto. Satoru Gojo mentored Yuta and enrolled him at Tokyo Jujutsu High.\n\nYuta is currently a second-year student at Jujutsu High where he works as a jujutsu sorcerer. He was training overseas in Africa with Miguel until after the Shibuya Incident when he returned to Tokyo.\n\nYuta is a young man of average height with disheveled black hair and dark blue eyes. As a first-year, Yuta's body language made it obvious that he was under a lot of stress. His posture was very unconfident, and he still has dark circles under his eyelids from a lack of sleep. As a second-year student, Yuta's hair has grown longer and he wears it in a more relaxed style instead of a spiky one.\n\nYuta was a very timid and lonely boy who was bullied a lot while growing up. Due to Rika haunting much of his early life, Yuta was unable to connect with other people and has lost all confidence in himself. This makes it difficult for Yuta to interact with others, as they often scare him without meaning to, or he's just too shy to speak to them.\n\nEven so, Yuta genuinely cared about other people and decided to isolate himself from them even if it means remaining alone. Maki Zenin called Yuta out for being a moody kid who's lived his entire life without goals. He acknowledged that this was true and used her advice to gain a resolve for being a jujutsu sorcerer. This helps Yuta realize that deep down, he truly desires the confidence to feel like he belongs.\n\nWhile his timid nature stays intact, Yuta slowly becomes more social and interacts with others normally. Gaining friends helps Yuta gain confidence in himself and establish the goal to help set Rika free. He felt responsible for her turning into a curse in the first place and worked extremely hard to find a way to help her. He pushed himself during training and took all his friends' and mentors' words to heart, showing a more determined side of himself. At his core, Yuta wants to become someone who can help keep others out of danger.",

The Time Vessel Association began in the Nara period during a time when Master Tengen first began to spread Japanese Buddhism. They preached what would become the foundation for jujutsu sorcerers. However the worlds of jujutsu and religion didn't agree and the Time Vessel Association was born from that disparity. The group maintained its monotheistic ideals all the way until the modern age. By 2006, the Time Vessel Association was a wealthy religious group that operated in the underbelly of the jujutsu world. They worshipped Master Tengen as their sovereign deity referred to as the \"Star\", making the organization officially known as the Star Religious Group to the public, a congregation of non-curse users that can't be targeted by jujutsu sorcerers. Followers of the faith were called Children of the Star.",

The cubic volume of the space appears completely different on the inside, making finding the boundary's location difficult for anyone trapped inside. Anyone searching for the edge of the domain is likely to be killed by its can't-miss attack and the barrier is reinforced from the inside even if they did find it. However, the more the barrier is reinforced from the inside, the more vulnerable it is to penetration from the outside. In specific situations, an ally of the domain's target can break in from the outside to rescue them.",

This will engage both combatants into a clash of domains where the more refined domain will conquer. The time it takes for one domain to dominate in a clash varies on that difference in refinement. E.g. Satoru Gojo's superior domain immediately dominated Jogo's while Dagon's domain took a much more significant amount of time to subdue Megumi's. In the case of overlapping domains, sure-hit effects cancel each other out. When two domains are completely even and the users fight with their domains open, the moment one combatant takes heavy damage or their domain collapses, the other's can't-miss attack will immediately strike. A clash of three domains is even more complicated than two and too many conflicting factors can cause the barriers to shatter before the domains are completely formed.\n\nDomain clashes don't always have to result in one domain conquering the other. Using Domain Expansion against a more refined domain can create a hole in the barrier for them to escape from as well.",

This same concept applies humanity's collective fear and hatred. An image of fear shared by the masses can create a powerful curse even if the subject is not real, such as famous monsters or ghosts. It is the negative emotions that humanity directed at this image that causes it to manifest as a curse.\n\nLongstanding negative feelings, such as humanity's collective relationship with plagues and natural disasters, results in a collection of cursed energy so massive the cursed spirits manifested from them have a consciousness related to those feelings. For example, humanity's fear and treatment of forests has directly resulted in Hanami, a very intelligent special grade cursed spirit who wants to free the earth of its humans in order to protect the forests and trees from them. Mahito is an exceptionally strong and intelligent curse that challenges the concept of the human soul itself because he was born from the hatred humans feel toward one another.",

This does not apply to curses who have been incarnated using a flesh and blood human vessel, such as the Cursed Womb: Death Paintings.\n\nCurses that are too powerful to be destroyed must be sealed away using a constraint. Sukuna has continued to exist as twenty fingers classified as special grade cursed objects that can still attract cursed spirits and choose its own vessel. Sukuna's fingers had to be individually sealed with talisman to inhibit the damage they cause.\n\nIf a vengeful spirit that is cursing someone is too powerful to exorcise, millions of figurative knots of cursed energy must be slowly analyzed and undone one by one. The cursed can do so by learning to master channeling the cursed energy being used to curse them. This was believed to be Yuta and Rika's case, however, Yuta was actually the one who turned her into a vengeful cursed spirit. If the cursed severs the bond tying servant to master and the curse doesn't desire punishment, then the curse breaks.

Sorcerers who summon shikigami to aid them in battle are known as Shikigami Users. Shikigami are age-old creations that gave Onmyodo its origins. These familiar monsters cannot be seen by non-sorcerers and are tamed to be subordinate to their master. They are summoned using mediums like talismans and other methods through a variety of sorcery techniques. Shikigami conjuration is considered to be a type of cursed technique. Like barrier techniques, sorcerers who do not possess enough intrinsic talent for their own innate technique can summon simple shikigami.\n\nShikigami themselves are familiars incarnated by their summoner's cursed energy. Summoning shikigami normally requires an intermediary, such as a common talisman. They are generally used to carry out an order in accordance with their conjurer's instructions, and they disappear when the user's technique is released or they are incapacitated.",

Jujutsu sorcerers are expected to take on missions involving curses of the same level. A Grade 2 sorcerer should be able to defeat a Grade 2 curse because their skill level is closer to the strength of a Grade 1 curse.\n\nCursed tools are also categorized from grades 1 to 4 based on power and potency. The higher the grade, the greater advantage they provide in battle. All Special Grade cursed tools except for Playful Cloud are imbued with a cursed technique.\n\nCursed objects are also classified according to the grade of the curse they contain.

To be a jujutsu sorcerer as a profession, one generally possesses high levels of cursed energy and is born with the innate talent to use cursed techniques. This normally composes over eighty percent of a jujutsu sorcerer's skillset.\n\nHowever, there are many exceptions to this, those without an innate technique (i.e. Yuji Itadori & Atsuya Kusakabe) and even those without the ability to control cursed energy at all can become professional jujutsu sorcerers (i.e. Maki Zenin) with the aid of cursed tools. All jujutsu sorcerers are trained in their youth at one of the two jujutsu educational facilities in either Tokyo or Kyoto. There they are taught about jujutsu and how to use their abilities to exorcise cursed spirits.\n\nAfter graduating, alumni sorcerers who remain aligned with the schools generally use one of the two facilities as a home base. They serve as the cornerstone for the jujutsu sorcerer community. They mediate issues, assign missions, and officially establish a payroll for all their employed exorcists. The higher-ups are in charge of the schools and by extension all jujutsu sorcerers.",

Naturally, there are several drawbacks to working as a professional exorcist. During their interview, Masamichi Yaga explains to Yuji that being fearless to the point of being even slightly insane is absolutely essential to being a jujutsu sorcerer. This is later confirmed by Satoru Gojo, who explains to Megumi Fushiguro, that even very talented, skilled and promising people, if they have a weak willpower, they are unable to deal with the trauma caused by grotesque monsters and the brutal scenes caused by cursed spirits and quickly give up working as sorcerers. According to Satoru Gojo, a person who is killed by a curse but dies a normal death, such a person is considered lucky. And even if the corpse is totally mutilated, as long as the body is found, it's still considered acceptable. Some humans who are capable of using jujutsu choose to become curse users simply because it offers a much easier life compared to being a jujutsu sorcerer.",

Due to their opposition to any type of progression and their unwillingness to bend any rules under any circumstances, the conservative faction often clashes with the world's strongest sorcerer, Satoru Gojo.

Some elements other than the buildings reflect the Buddhist theme. There are several statues of deities, shrines, and torii gates around the campus.\n\nThere are several entrances into the school. The entire property is hidden by a protective barrier maintained by Master Tengen, who lives beneath the school in the star's underground tombs.

The Principal is appointed by Jujutsu Headquarters based on recommendations of the Big Three Sorcerer Families. Jujutsu Headquarters has the commanding authority of the Principal and the commander can take control over all sorcerers in the case of an emergency. Jujutsu sorcerers must report any source of danger to the Principal. Based on their report, the Principal will determine the level of danger, notify Jujutsu Headquarters, and dispatch the necessary personnel and resources to neutralize the threat.\n\nJujutsu Headquarters is predominantly controlled by the conservative faction of the higher-ups that often clash with Satoru Gojo, including members such as Kyoto Principal, Yoshinobu Gakuganji. The members of the higher-ups meet on campus to discuss developments in meetings with selected sorcerers, such as Satoru. These meetings take place in a dimly lit room illuminated by candle lights where the higher-up's bodies are hidden by doors. Many of the politics that play out due to the influence of the higher-ups affect the students. For example, both Yuta Okkotsu and Yuji Itadori were sentenced to death by Jujutsu Headquarters before they were vouched for by Satoru and enrolled in Jujutsu High.",

Sorcerers are rare, so classes are often small and focused on building up the individual students into competent sorcerers as quickly as possible.\n\nStudents are given a formal education with standard school classes such as homeroom and sorcerer training through practical jujutsu classes. They move from their original homes to live on campus in the dormitories. The majority of training, classes, and school events are all conducted on campus grounds.\n\nPractical training assignments and field tests often consist of investigating paranormal locations and exorcising weaker curses. Jujutsu High students are ranked on the same scale as professional jujutsu sorcerers, which their student ID reflects. Same as jujutsu sorcerers, students are given missions according to their ranking. When leaving school grounds to exorcise curses as a part of their training to gain experience, students are often supervised by a sorcerer or manager.",

Only one door leads to the corridor but there are over a thousand doors that continuously shuffle. The correct door opens to a massive drop with tall old trees with no foliage below. This leads to the space between the entrance and the actual tomb. It is an indoor forest area with trees, grass, and dirt. Jujutsu High's cursed warehouse where they store cursed objects is located in this area.\n\nDeeper inside is an elevator that descends underground to the main corridor. The main hall consists of a compound of old buildings that circle around a gigantic tree. There is a path that leads directly to the base of the tree where Master Tengen resides. The bloodstains from Riko Amani's death still remain on this path eleven years later.\n\nThere is also another barrier at the entrance to Master Tengen's shrine that prevents anyone from intruding other than those directly invited. If one were to enter and be rejected, they would walk into an empty white space void of Master Tengen's presence.",

Alongside jujutsu headquarters, they are in contact with the Japanese government and were key in establishing the memorandum regarding the obligations of jujutsu sorcerers. The head of Jujutsu Headquarters is appointed by the Prime Minister based on nominations from the Big Three.
